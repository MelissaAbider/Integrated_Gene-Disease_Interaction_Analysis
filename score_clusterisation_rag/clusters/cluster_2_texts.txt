The ability to distinguish vinblastine responders from non-responders would be helpful for maximizing the therapeutic benefit of vinblastine therapy in BRCA1-associated breast cancer.
--------
To test whether the mitotic arrest associated with induction of cyclin B1 suppresses BRCA1-mutant breast cancer in vivo, we examined the effect of vinblastine in an allograft model of transplanted mammary tumor tissues from Brca1co/coMMTV-cre mice, which spontaneously develop mammary tumors starting at ~10 months of age.
--------
Cyclin B1 stability is increased by interaction with BRCA1, and its overexpression suppresses the progression of BRCA1-associated mammary tumors
--------
These findings enhance our understanding of how loss of BRCA1 disrupts mitosis regulation through dysregulation of cyclin B1 and provide evidence suggesting that targeting cyclin B1 may be useful in BRCA1-associated breast cancer therapy.
--------
We further characterized the interaction of BRCA1 and cyclin B1 and performed preclinical tests of vinblastine, a cyclin B1-inducing agent, in the treatment of BRCA1-associated mammary tumors using a Brca1-mutant allograft model.
--------
Considering the current limitations in available treatment options for BRCA1-associated breast cancer, preclinical simulation in a mouse model, such as our approach using Brca1-mutant mice bearing endogenous tumors, will remain a useful strategy for testing treatment efficacy.
--------
However, to date, the role of BRCA1 interactions at specific stages in the progression of mammary tumors, particularly in relation to cell cycle regulation, remains elusive.
--------
These findings enhance our understanding of how loss of BRCA1 disrupts mitosis regulation through dysregulation of cyclin B1 and provide evidence suggesting that targeting cyclin B1 may be useful in BRCA1-associated breast cancer therapy.
--------
Considering this strategy, we also provided evidence that modulating mitotic progression and cyclin B1 expression could be therapeutically beneficial in the treatment of BRCA1-associated breast cancer.
--------
The results obtained in the current study using this mouse simulation system suggest that targeting of mitosis and cyclin B1 could be a useful strategy for treating BRCA1-associated breast cancer.
--------
Maximizing the therapeutic benefit of vinblastine treatment of BRCA1-associated mammary tumors would be facilitated by the ability to distinguish potential responders by analyzing the tumor at baseline (i.e., before initiation of treatment).
--------
To further investigate the contribution of cyclin B1 in the vinblastine-induced growth suppression of BRCA1-associated breast cancer cells, we transfected the Brca1Δ11/Δ11p53−/− mammary tumor cell line with siRNA against Ccnb1 and examined the effect of vinblastine.
--------
To test whether the mitotic arrest associated with induction of cyclin B1 suppresses BRCA1-mutant breast cancer in vivo, we examined the effect of vinblastine in an allograft model of transplanted mammary tumor tissues from Brca1co/coMMTV-cre mice, which spontaneously develop mammary tumors starting at ~10 months of age.
--------
Compared with normal mammary tissues, cyclin D1 was overexpressed in asynchronous cultured cells from Brca1-mutant tumors, but cyclins A, B1, and E were not detectable, indicating that mammary tumors caused by the loss of BRCA1 are associated with a deficiency of cyclin B116.
--------
To examine the effect of vinblastine on BRCA1-associated breast cancer, we assessed the survival of Brca1Δ11/Δ11p53−/−mammary tumor cell lines following treatment with increasing concentrations of vinblastine.
--------
In addition, to increase the potential clinical efficacy of vinblastine against BRCA1-deficient breast cancer, we also sought to identify specific efficacy-associated genes by examining gene expression patterns in untreated tumors.
--------
Previous studies have reported that mammary tumors that spontaneously develop in BRCA1-deficient mice can be orthotopically transplanted into female mice without loss of their original phenotype, gene expression profile, or sensitivity to anticancer agents31,32.
--------
We further demonstrate that treatment of Brca1-mutant mammary tumors with vinblastine, which induces cyclin B1, significantly reduced tumor progression.
--------
Cyclin B1 stability is increased by interaction with BRCA1, and its overexpression suppresses the progression of BRCA1-associated mammary tumors
--------
Treatment of Brca1-mutant mammary tumors with vinblastine, which alters cyclin B1 level, significantly reduced tumor progression with reduction of survival and induction of apoptosis.
--------
To test whether the mitotic arrest associated with induction of cyclin B1 suppresses BRCA1-mutant breast cancer in vivo, we examined the effect of vinblastine in an allograft model of transplanted mammary tumor tissues from Brca1co/coMMTV-cre mice, which spontaneously develop mammary tumors starting at ~10 months of age.

We further characterized the interaction of BRCA1 and cyclin B1 and performed preclinical tests of vinblastine, a cyclin B1-inducing agent, in the treatment of BRCA1-associated mammary tumors using a Brca1-mutant allograft model.
--------
Through our mechanistic studies we have identified the NEAT1/miR-129-5p/WNT4 axis and revealed that dysregulation of this signaling axis contributes to BRCA1-deficiency-induced malignant phenotypes in breast cancer cells, such as increases in cell proliferation, invasiveness, anchorage-independent growth and stemness.
--------
Given variable genetic and epigenetic alterations among these breast cancer cell lines, we predicted that some cell lines had lost the BRCA1/NEAT1/miR-129- 5p regulation axis.
--------
Due to the pivotal role of BRCA1 in mammary gland development and the large similarity between sporadic BLBCs and hereditary BRCA1-defective breast cancers, it has been postulated that BRCA1 deficiency attenuates breast CSC (BCSC) differentiation, resulting in accumulation of BCSCs in BLBCs [20].
--------
The relevance of the BRCA1/NEAT1/miR-129-5p axis in breast cancer
--------
To determine if NEAT1 is functionally required for the in vivo tumorigenicity of BRCA1-deficienct breast tumor cells, we isolated primary tumor cells from Brca1-deficient mammary tumors developed in MMTV-Cre;Brca1Co/Co mice and established stable Neat1 knockdown in primary Brca1 mutant mammary tumor cell cultures as described in Supplementary Figure S6.
--------
To determine if NEAT1 is functionally required for the in vivo tumorigenicity of BRCA1-deficienct breast tumor cells, we isolated primary tumor cells from Brca1-deficient mammary tumors developed in MMTV-Cre;Brca1Co/Co mice and established stable Neat1 knockdown in primary Brca1 mutant mammary tumor cell cultures as described in Supplementary Figure S6.
--------
Moreover, our in silico correlation analysis indicates that a significant portion of breast cancer cell lines (> 70%) manifested the regulation trend of the BRCA1/NEAT1/miR-129-5p axis.
--------
We further analyzed the expression correlation between BRCA1 and miR-129-5p in these 31 BC lines.
--------
To reveal how relevant the BRCA1/NEAT1/miR-129-5p signaling axis is to breast cancer, we performed in silico analysis of publicly available cancer-related expression databases and published expression data to examine the expression correlation between these three molecules.
--------
Consistent with findings from human breast tumor cells (Figure 3E), Neat1 knockdown suppressed in vitro self-renewal of CSCs in mouse Brca1 mutant mammary tumors (Supplementary Figure S6B).
--------
Due to the pivotal role of BRCA1 in mammary gland development and the large similarity between sporadic BLBCs and hereditary BRCA1-defective breast cancers, it has been postulated that BRCA1 deficiency attenuates breast CSC (BCSC) differentiation, resulting in accumulation of BCSCs in BLBCs [20].
--------
To determine if NEAT1 is functionally required for the in vivo tumorigenicity of BRCA1-deficienct breast tumor cells, we isolated primary tumor cells from Brca1-deficient mammary tumors developed in MMTV-Cre;Brca1Co/Co mice and established stable Neat1 knockdown in primary Brca1 mutant mammary tumor cell cultures as described in Supplementary Figure S6.
--------
By in silico analysis of this 38-line cohort, we revealed that over 90% of these BC lines manifested the negative correlation between BRCA1 and NEAT1, consistent with the BRCA1/NEAT1 regulation axis identified from our aforementioned studies.
--------
However, the properties of BCSCs in BRCA1-defective breast cancers and the BRCA1-deficiency-triggered molecular alterations are still largely uncharacterized.
--------
The discovery of the BRCA1/NEAT1/miR-129-5p/WNT4 axis and the pivotal roles of WNT4 in WNT signaling activation as well as in the enhancement of BCSC generation suggest that WNT signaling is a potential therapeutic target for breast cancer with alterations in this signaling axis.
--------
These in silico analyses, taken together, indicate that 29 (76.3%) out of 38 BC lines exhibited the trend of BRCA1/NEAT1/miR-129-5p axis regulation.
--------
Moreover, we found that NEAT1 upregulation is required for the BRCA1-deficiency-driven effect on increasing the EpCAM+BCSC population and enhancing malignancies of breast cancer cells.
--------
To test the effect of Neat1 knockdown on Brca1-deficient mammary tumor development, we perform in vivo tumorigenicity analysis on scramble (as a control) and Neat1 shRNA transfectants of primary tumor cell cultures.
--------
Moreover, NEAT1 is crucial for tumorigenicity of BRCA1-deficient breast cancer.
--------
To determine if NEAT1 is functionally required for the in vivo tumorigenicity of BRCA1-deficienct breast tumor cells, we isolated primary tumor cells from Brca1-deficient mammary tumors developed in MMTV-Cre;Brca1Co/Co mice and established stable Neat1 knockdown in primary Brca1 mutant mammary tumor cell cultures as described in Supplementary Figure S6.
--------
In conclusion, for the first time we have identified that NEAT1 plays oncogenic roles in promoting tumorigenicity and stemness of BRCA1-deficient breast cancer.
--------
As shown in Figure 3H, Neat1 knockdown by two different Neat1 shRNAs significantly impaired the development of Brca1-deficient xenograft mammary tumors.
--------
To verify this finding, we performed BRCA1 knockdown experiments using two different siRNAs [42, 43] on MCF10A and the luminal breast cancer cell line MCF7, which both express wild-type BRCA1.
--------
To determine if NEAT1 is functionally required for the in vivo tumorigenicity of BRCA1-deficienct breast tumor cells, we isolated primary tumor cells from Brca1-deficient mammary tumors developed in MMTV-Cre;Brca1Co/Co mice and established stable Neat1 knockdown in primary Brca1 mutant mammary tumor cell cultures as described in Supplementary Figure S6.
--------
Finally our in silico expression correlation analysis suggests the existence of the BRCA1/NEAT1/miR-129-5p axis in breast cancer.
--------
Similar to TOP1, increased CHD3 expression was associated with BRCA1/2-related breast carcinoma, independent of TNBC and age.
--------
Multiple logistic regression was performed to estimate the predictive effects of TOP1 or CDH3 for BRCA1/2-related breast carcinomas when adjusted for triple negative breast cancer and age (Table 2).
--------
TOP1 overexpression was mostly observed in BRCA1-related (60%) and in BRCA2-related breast carcinomas (59%) as compared to sporadic breast carcinomas (35%).
--------
Gorski et al. [25] have shown that BRCA1 is a transcriptional repressor of CDH3, thereby providing a biological explanation for our observation of the strong presence of CDH3 in BRCA1-deficient breast carcinomas and large abundance in BRCA1-deficient secretome.
--------
A significantly higher rate was found in BRCA1-related compared with BRCA2-related breast carcinomas (p < 0.001) as well as with sporadic carcinomas (p < 0.001), while no difference was found between BRCA2-related breast carcinomas and sporadic breast carcinomas (p = 0.11).
--------
A significantly higher rate was found in BRCA1-related compared with BRCA2-related breast carcinomas (p < 0.001) as well as with sporadic carcinomas (p < 0.001), while no difference was found between BRCA2-related breast carcinomas and sporadic breast carcinomas (p = 0.11).
--------
Therefore, we here applied immunohistochemistry for verification of increased expression of TOP1 and CDH3 in BRCA1-deficient breast carcinomas.
--------
For example, employing proteomic analysis on conditional GEMMs for BRCA1-deficient and -proficient breast tumors, we have previously identified a tissue-specific signature of 45 proteins, that can discriminate human BRCA1- and BRCA2-deficient breast carcinomas from other familial or sporadic breast carcinomas [8–10].
--------
We demonstrated that BRCA1-deficient secretome proteins could cluster most human BRCA1- and BRCA2-related breast carcinomas at the transcriptome level.
--------
In the present study, TOP1 was detected at an increased level in the BRCA1-deficient secretome and exosome-like vesicles as well as in human BRCA1-related breast carcinomas.
--------
Of note, the rates of TOP1 and CDH3 positivity were the highest in BRCA1-related breast carcinomas (48%) followed by BRCA2-related (24%) and sporadic breast carcinomas (7%).
--------
Protein expression of CDH3 and TOP1 was analysed in a panel of 253 human breast carcinomas comprising 102 BRCA1-related, 49 BRCA2-related and 102 sporadic breast carcinomas.
--------
Multiple logistic regression of TOP1 and CDH3 for BRCA1/2-related breast carcinomas
--------
Similarly, an independent association of CDH3 expression for BRCA1/2-related breast carcinomas was found (adjusted OR 2.44; 95% CI, 1.08–5.49, p = 0.032).
--------
We demonstrated increased CDH3 levels in a large panel of human BRCA1-related breast carcinomas.
--------
For example, employing proteomic analysis on conditional GEMMs for BRCA1-deficient and -proficient breast tumors, we have previously identified a tissue-specific signature of 45 proteins, that can discriminate human BRCA1- and BRCA2-deficient breast carcinomas from other familial or sporadic breast carcinomas [8–10].
--------
We report that TOP1 and CDH3 were expressed to a higher extent in BRCA1-related breast carcinomas relative to sporadic breast carcinomas, highlighting their potential clinical usefulness for breast cancer detection in women with a BRCA1 mutation.
--------
Multiple logistic regression showed that TOP1 (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 3.75; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.85 - 7.71, p < 0.001) as well as CDH3 positivity (adjusted OR 2.45; 95% CI, 1.08 - 5.49, p = 0.032) were associated with BRCA1/2-related breast carcinomas after adjustment for triple-negative phenotype and age.
--------
TOP1 overexpression was mostly observed in BRCA1-related (60%) and in BRCA2-related breast carcinomas (59%) as compared to sporadic breast carcinomas (35%).
--------
We showed that expression of TOP1 and CDH3 was significantly increased in human BRCA1-related breast carcinomas relative to sporadic cases (p = 0.002 and p < 0.001, respectively).
--------
We demonstrated that BRCA1-deficient secretome proteins could cluster most human BRCA1- and BRCA2-related breast carcinomas at the transcriptome level.
--------
In the present study, TOP1 was detected at an increased level in the BRCA1-deficient secretome and exosome-like vesicles as well as in human BRCA1-related breast carcinomas.
--------

--------
There was a significant difference between BRCA1-related and sporadic breast carcinomas in terms of CDH3-positive cases (p < 0.001).
--------
TOP1 expression was independently associated with BRCA1/2-related breast carcinomas (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 3.75; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.82–7.71, p < 0.001).
--------
Hierarchical cluster analysis showed that the mapped mRNA transcripts could separate the majority of the BRCA1/2 -deficient breast carcinomas from the majority of sporadic breast carcinomas (Figure 2).
--------
We report that TOP1 and CDH3 were expressed to a higher extent in BRCA1-related breast carcinomas relative to sporadic breast carcinomas, highlighting their potential clinical usefulness for breast cancer detection in women with a BRCA1 mutation.

--------
With regard to CDH3, a significant difference was found among the three groups with 76% of BRCA1-related, 37% of BRCA2-related and 22% of sporadic breast carcinomas being CDH3 positive (p < 0.001).
--------
Gorski et al. [25] have shown that BRCA1 is a transcriptional repressor of CDH3, thereby providing a biological explanation for our observation of the strong presence of CDH3 in BRCA1-deficient breast carcinomas and large abundance in BRCA1-deficient secretome.
--------
Among them were several nuclear proteins, which have previously been identified in BRCA1-deficient breast carcinomas (TOP1, SMC3, SSRP1 and DHX9, Supplementary Figure 10).
--------
More importantly, we validated two candidate proteins demonstrating, in accordance with animal data, increased expression in human BRCA1-related breast carcinomas.
--------
Comparison between BRCA1-related and sporadic breast carcinomas demonstrated a significant difference in TOP1 expression (p = 0.002).
--------
Hierarchical cluster analysis showed that the mapped mRNA transcripts could separate the majority of the BRCA1/2 -deficient breast carcinomas from the majority of sporadic breast carcinomas (Figure 2).
--------
Using a high-throughput drug screen, we identified synergy between inhibition of EZH2 and ATM with specific cytotoxicity in BRCA1-deficient tumor cells, thereby providing a molecularly rationalized approach that could guide clinical investigations of a combined therapy with EZH2 and ATM inhibitors in BRCA1-deficient breast cancer.
--------
BRCA1-deficient and -proficient mouse mammary tumor cells were treated with increasing concentrations of one compound in the absence or presence of a fixed concentration of the other compound and vice versa (Additional file 3: Fig. S3).
--------
We provide a rationalized approach of a synergistic therapy with EZH2 and ATM inhibition in BRCA1-deficient breast cancer that could guide further preclinical and clinical investigations.
--------
In order to identify synthetic lethal partners of EZH2 that are specifically effective in BRCA1-deficient breast cancer, we used BRCA1-deficient and -proficient mammary tumor cell lines to perform a high-throughput drug screen in combination with GSK126.
--------
We then determined the IC50 value of GSK126 for all cell clones, showing that 3- to 11-fold lower concentrations of GSK126 were required for a 50% reduction in viability in BRCA1-deficient compared to BRCA1-proficient cells, indicating that BRCA1-deficient mammary tumor cells are more sensitive to EZH2 inhibition (Fig. 1C; KB1P-G3: IC50 = 13.4 μM; KB1P-B11: IC50 = 17.6 μM; KP-3.33: IC50 = 44.9 μM; KP-6.3: IC50 = 148.9 μM).
--------
To investigate the cytotoxic effect of combined EZH2 and ATM inhibition in human BRCA1-mutant breast cancer, we treated the human TNBC cell lines SUM149 (BRCA1-mutant) and CAL120 (BRCA1-wild type) with GSK126 and AZD1390, and analyzed cell viability using CellTiter-Glo and clonogenic survival (Fig. 4A, B).
--------
Taken together, we identified a synthetic lethal interaction between EZH2 and ATM and propose this synergistic interaction as a novel molecular combination for the treatment of BRCA1-mutant breast cancer.
--------
We therefore aimed to identify synthetic lethal partners of EZH2 in BRCA1-deficient breast cancer.
--------
We then determined the IC50 value of GSK126 for all cell clones, showing that 3- to 11-fold lower concentrations of GSK126 were required for a 50% reduction in viability in BRCA1-deficient compared to BRCA1-proficient cells, indicating that BRCA1-deficient mammary tumor cells are more sensitive to EZH2 inhibition (Fig. 1C; KB1P-G3: IC50 = 13.4 μM; KB1P-B11: IC50 = 17.6 μM; KP-3.33: IC50 = 44.9 μM; KP-6.3: IC50 = 148.9 μM).
--------
Significantly increased Ezh2 expression in female BRCA1-deficient K14cre; Brca1F/F; Trp53F/F (KB1P) mouse mammary tumors compared to BRCA1-proficient K14cre; Trp53F/F (KP) mammary tumors was further corroborated by RNA sequencing of tumor tissue (p = 0.0156; Fig. 1A, right panel).
--------
To investigate whether combined EZH2/ATM inhibition induces apoptosis in BRCA1-deficient mouse mammary tumor cells, we measured the percentage of Annexin V/propidium iodide double-positive cells by flow-cytometry (Fig. 3D).
--------
Combined treatment with the EZH2 inhibitor GSK126 and cisplatin led to increased cytotoxicity and reduced colony formation in BRCA1-deficient mouse mammary tumor cells [14].
--------
In order to identify synthetic lethal partners of EZH2 that are specifically effective in BRCA1-deficient breast cancer, we used BRCA1-deficient and -proficient mammary tumor cell lines to perform a high-throughput drug screen in combination with GSK126.
--------
We show that the combined treatment with the EZH2 inhibitor GSK126 and the ATM inhibitor AZD1390 led to reduced colony formation, increased genotoxic stress, and apoptosis-mediated cell death in BRCA1-deficient mammary tumor cells in vitro.
--------
Combined inhibition of EZH2 and ATM is synthetic lethal in BRCA1-deficient breast cancer
--------
To study the role of EZH2 in BRCA1-mutant breast cancer, we made use of previously described murine tumor cell lines derived from KB1P (clones KB1P-G3 and KB1P-B11) or KP (clones KP-3.33 and KP-6.3) mammary tumors [29].
--------
In order to identify synthetic lethal partners of EZH2 that are specifically effective in BRCA1-deficient breast cancer, we used BRCA1-deficient and -proficient mammary tumor cell lines to perform a high-throughput drug screen in combination with GSK126.
--------
Using a high-throughput drug screen, we identified synergy between inhibition of EZH2 and ATM with specific cytotoxicity in BRCA1-deficient tumor cells, thereby providing a molecularly rationalized approach that could guide clinical investigations of a combined therapy with EZH2 and ATM inhibitors in BRCA1-deficient breast cancer.
--------
These results indicate that combined EZH2/ATM inhibition induces increased DNA damage in BRCA1-deficient mouse mammary tumor cells.
--------
Our in vivo study shows that the combined treatment with GSK126 and AZD1390 confers stronger anti-tumor activity than either inhibitor alone in BRCA1-deficient mammary tumors in mice, although the effect on progression-free survival was not strong.
--------
Our data suggest that EZH2 inhibition can be combined with ATM inhibition to provoke toxic DSBs leading to apoptosis-mediated cell death in BRCA1-deficient breast cancer cells (Fig. 7).
--------
Patients with BRCA1-mutant breast cancer and high EZH2 expression showed an improved therapeutic response and less frequent disease recurrence after treatment with intensified platinum-based chemotherapy, compared to standard chemotherapy [14].
--------
Recent work from our group and others has highlighted histone methyltransferase EZH2 (Enhancer of zeste homolog 2) as a promising target in BRCA1-deficient breast cancer [14–16].
--------
Significantly increased Ezh2 expression in female BRCA1-deficient K14cre; Brca1F/F; Trp53F/F (KB1P) mouse mammary tumors compared to BRCA1-proficient K14cre; Trp53F/F (KP) mammary tumors was further corroborated by RNA sequencing of tumor tissue (p = 0.0156; Fig. 1A, right panel).
--------
Here, the association of EZH2 mRNA expression with BRCA1-mutant breast cancer was further evaluated using the TCGA BRCA whole exome sequencing data set (n = 526) confirming the increased expression of EZH2 in BRCA1-mutant (n = 18), compared to BRCA1-wild type breast cancer (n = 508) (p = 0.0003; Fig. 1A, left panel).
--------
These findings were corroborated by in vivo experiments showing that simultaneous inhibition of EZH2 and ATM significantly increased anti-tumor activity in mice bearing BRCA1-deficient mammary tumors.
--------
To confirm that the observed treatment effect is due to combined EZH2/ATM inhibition and not caused by any potential off-target effect, BRCA1-deficient and -proficient mouse mammary tumor cells were treated with the structurally distinct EZH2 and ATM inhibitors ZLD1039 [36] and KU60019 [31], respectively (Fig. 4C, D).
--------
To study the role of EZH2 in BRCA1-mutant breast cancer, we made use of previously described murine tumor cell lines derived from KB1P (clones KB1P-G3 and KB1P-B11) or KP (clones KP-3.33 and KP-6.3) mammary tumors [29].
--------
Assessment of clonogenic survival revealed a substantial decrease in the number of colonies by combined GSK126/AZD1390 treatment in BRCA1-deficient mouse mammary tumor cells, compared to vehicle control, as well as to single GSK126 or AZD1390 treatment (Fig. 3A).
--------
The results of double agent treatment in vivo suggest a combination effect by GSK126/AZD1390 treatment and support our in vitro findings of increased sensitivity in BRCA1-deficient mammary tumor cells.
--------
Here, the association of EZH2 mRNA expression with BRCA1-mutant breast cancer was further evaluated using the TCGA BRCA whole exome sequencing data set (n = 526) confirming the increased expression of EZH2 in BRCA1-mutant (n = 18), compared to BRCA1-wild type breast cancer (n = 508) (p = 0.0003; Fig. 1A, left panel).
--------
We used immunofluorescence staining as a more sensitive technique to detect yH2AX changes, together with the previously established automated high-throughput microscopy [39] to improve accuracy for counting of yH2AX foci formation and to assess the level of DNA damage and repair ability in BRCA1-deficient and BRCA1-proficient mouse mammary tumor cells treated with GSK126 and AZD1390 (Fig. 5A, B).
--------
Here, the association of EZH2 mRNA expression with BRCA1-mutant breast cancer was further evaluated using the TCGA BRCA whole exome sequencing data set (n = 526) confirming the increased expression of EZH2 in BRCA1-mutant (n = 18), compared to BRCA1-wild type breast cancer (n = 508) (p = 0.0003; Fig. 1A, left panel).
--------
SUM149 cells were specifically sensitive to combined GSK126/AZD1390 inhibition leading to a significantly reduced cell viability by 77–79%, compared to vehicle control (p = 0.02) or single agent treatment (GSK126: p = 0.02; AZD1390: p = 0.03), while no effect was observed in CAL120 cells (Fig. 4A), suggesting that the cytotoxic effect by EZH2/ATM inhibition might be specific to BRCA1 mutation status in human breast cancer cells.
--------
Effective in vivo anti-tumor activity of combined GSK126 and cisplatin treatment also enhanced overall survival of mice bearing BRCA1-deficient mouse mammary tumors, suggesting that EZH2 inhibition enhances the sensitivity to platinum drugs in EZH2-overexpressing breast tumors [14].
--------
The underlying mechanism of increased cytotoxicity by combined EZH2/ATM inhibition in BRCA1-deficient breast cancer cells is not clear.
--------
To validate the role of EZH2 as a therapeutic target and to identify new synergistic drug combinations, we performed a high-throughput drug combination screen in various cell lines derived from BRCA1-deficient and -proficient mouse mammary tumors.
--------
We used immunofluorescence staining as a more sensitive technique to detect yH2AX changes, together with the previously established automated high-throughput microscopy [39] to improve accuracy for counting of yH2AX foci formation and to assess the level of DNA damage and repair ability in BRCA1-deficient and BRCA1-proficient mouse mammary tumor cells treated with GSK126 and AZD1390 (Fig. 5A, B).
--------
Combination effect of EZH2/ATM inhibition in BRCA1-deficient mouse mammary tumor allografts
--------
Significantly increased Ezh2 expression in female BRCA1-deficient K14cre; Brca1F/F; Trp53F/F (KB1P) mouse mammary tumors compared to BRCA1-proficient K14cre; Trp53F/F (KP) mammary tumors was further corroborated by RNA sequencing of tumor tissue (p = 0.0156; Fig. 1A, right panel).
--------
The ability of combined EZH2/ATM inhibition to propagate DNA damage in BRCA1-deficient breast cancer could enhance the response to immuno-oncological treatment.
--------
We then determined the IC50 value of GSK126 for all cell clones, showing that 3- to 11-fold lower concentrations of GSK126 were required for a 50% reduction in viability in BRCA1-deficient compared to BRCA1-proficient cells, indicating that BRCA1-deficient mammary tumor cells are more sensitive to EZH2 inhibition (Fig. 1C; KB1P-G3: IC50 = 13.4 μM; KB1P-B11: IC50 = 17.6 μM; KP-3.33: IC50 = 44.9 μM; KP-6.3: IC50 = 148.9 μM).
--------
Together, these results indicate that the synergistic cytotoxicity of combined EZH2/ATM inhibition in BRCA1-deficient mouse mammary tumor cells is mediated by apoptosis.
--------
Here, the association of EZH2 mRNA expression with BRCA1-mutant breast cancer was further evaluated using the TCGA BRCA whole exome sequencing data set (n = 526) confirming the increased expression of EZH2 in BRCA1-mutant (n = 18), compared to BRCA1-wild type breast cancer (n = 508) (p = 0.0003; Fig. 1A, left panel).
--------
We indeed found that BRCA1-deficient mouse mammary tumors have higher EZH2 protein levels than control tumors, also indicated by the higher percentage of tumor cells with EZH2 expression above background (77% in KB1P tumors versus 11.5% in KP tumors; Wilcoxon P < 0.029; Figure 1c).
--------
Moreover, the knock-down experiments show that BRCA1-deficient mammary tumor cells are dependent on EZH2 for their survival.
--------
To define the molecular changes associated with BRCA1-deficient breast cancer, we previously compared BRCA1-deficient (KB1P) mammary tumors derived from our conditional K14cre;Brca1F/F;p53F/F mouse model for hereditary breast cancer with BRCA1-proficient mammary tumors (KP) derived from K14cre;Brca1w.
--------
To determine whether the increased EZH2 levels are functionally relevant in the BRCA1-deficient tumor cells, we made use of cell lines that were derived from KB1P and KP mouse mammary tumors [23].
--------
In this study, we demonstrate that EZH2 expression is high in breast tumors from BRCA1-mutation carriers, similar to that observed in our mouse model for BRCA1-deficient breast cancer.
--------
Next, we determined whether EZH2 is also overexpressed in human BRCA1-deficient breast cancer.
--------
In summary, we have demonstrated that DZNep selectively inhibits BRCA1-deficient but not BRCA1-proficient mammary tumor cells, and that this effect is mainly due to the fact that BRCA1-deficient cells are dependent on EZH2, whereas BRCA1-proficient cells are not.
--------
To define the molecular changes associated with BRCA1-deficient breast cancer, we previously compared BRCA1-deficient (KB1P) mammary tumors derived from our conditional K14cre;Brca1F/F;p53F/F mouse model for hereditary breast cancer with BRCA1-proficient mammary tumors (KP) derived from K14cre;Brca1w.
--------
Importantly, our mouse model allows us to compare BRCA1-deficient mammary tumors (arising in K14cre;Brca1F/F;p53F/F (KB1P) mice) with BRCA1-proficient control tumors (arising in K14cre;Brca1w.

--------
Our data show that BRCA1-deficient tumor cells are selectively dependent on EZH2 expression, and suggest that pharmacological disruption of EZH2 could provide another individualized approach for the treatment of BRCA1-mutated breast cancers, and possibly also for sporadic basal-like breast tumors.

IC50 values of DZNep and TSA on BRCA1-proficient vs. BRCA1-deficient mammary tumor cells

--------
IC50 values of DZNep on BRCA1-deficient vs. BRCA1-reconstituted mammary tumor cells
--------
In this study, we demonstrate that EZH2 expression is high in breast tumors from BRCA1-mutation carriers, similar to that observed in our mouse model for BRCA1-deficient breast cancer.
--------
IC50 values of DZNep and TSA on BRCA1-proficient vs. BRCA1-deficient mammary tumor cells
--------
In addition, a chemical inhibitor of EZH2, 3-deazaneplanocin A (DZNep), is about 20-fold more effective in killing BRCA1-deficient cells compared to BRCA1-proficient mammary tumor cells.
--------
Tumors from BRCA1-mutation carriers belong to this group of aggressive breast cancer, and accordingly EZH2 mRNA levels are also high in human BRCA1-deficient tumors (Figure 2a).
--------
Ezh2 expression is elevated in BRCA1-deficient mouse mammary tumors
--------
This would indicate that EZH2 constitutes a therapeutic target for BRCA1-deficient breast cancer.
--------
We investigated a mouse model that closely mimics breast cancer arising in BRCA1-mutation carriers to better understand the molecular mechanism of tumor progression and tested whether targeting of the Polycomb-group protein EZH2 would be a putative therapy for BRCA1-deficient tumors.
--------
BRCA1-deficient mammary tumor cells are dependent on EZH2 expression and sensitive to Polycomb Repressive Complex 2-inhibitor 3-deazaneplanocin A
--------
We developed a mouse model mimicking human BRCA1-deficient breast cancer to gain insight into the molecular progression of BRCA1-deficient tumors and to test putative therapies [12].
--------
IC50 values of DZNep on BRCA1-deficient vs. BRCA1-reconstituted mammary tumor cells
--------
In the study presented here, we set out to determine whether increased EZH2 expression also characterizes human BRCA1-deficient breast cancer, and whether BRCA1-deficient tumor cells are dependent on high EZH2 levels for their survival.
--------
To define the molecular changes associated with BRCA1-deficient breast cancer, we previously compared BRCA1-deficient (KB1P) mammary tumors derived from our conditional K14cre;Brca1F/F;p53F/F mouse model for hereditary breast cancer with BRCA1-proficient mammary tumors (KP) derived from K14cre;Brca1w.
--------
We demonstrate by specific knock-down experiments that EZH2 overexpression is functionally relevant in BRCA1-deficient breast cancer cells.
--------
Gene expression analysis demonstrated that EZH2 is overexpressed in BRCA1-deficient mouse mammary tumors.
--------
After comparing gene expression patterns of BRCA1-deficient mouse mammary tumors with BRCA1-proficient control tumors, we noted that Ezh2 expression was particularly high in BRCA1-deficient tumors.

It was recently shown that an efficacious response to tamoxifen also requires Her-2 and PAX2 9, suggesting that tamoxifen treatment may not be sufficient to inhibit endogenous estrogen signaling and prevent BRCA1-associated mammary tumor formation.
--------
Thus, preclinical simulation with a mouse model is a good experimental stand-in for testing treatment efficacy in BRCA1-associated breast cancer.
--------
We herein show that estrogen signaling plays an important role in the tumorigenesis attributable to Brca1 mutation, and provide evidence that targeting ER-α could be therapeutically relevant for preventing BRCA1-associated breast cancer.
--------
Here, we examined the effects of estrogen on the accumulation of genetic instabilities upon loss of BRCA1, and assessed the contribution of estrogen signaling to the incidence and progression of Brca1-mutated mammary tumors.
--------
We found that administration of fulvestrant was not able to significantly suppress the progression of ER-α-expressing Brca1-mutant mammary tumors.

--------
Inhibition of Estrogen Signaling Reduces the Incidence of BRCA1-associated Mammary Tumor Formation
--------
The contribution of estrogen signaling to the onset of BRCA1-associated breast cancer remains a matter of controversy.
--------
In contrast, treatment of Brca1-mutant mice with tamoxifen was shown to produce no chemopreventive effects against mammary cancer development 8.
--------
Our in vitro studies showed that treatment of BRCA1-depleted breast cancer cells with estrogen induced proliferation.
--------
Thus, we tested whether suppression of estrogen signaling could effectively control the progression of ER-positive BRCA1-mutation-induced mammary tumors.
--------
In these studies, the contribution of estrogen signaling to BRCA1-deficient mammary tumor formation was assessed by examining mammary tumor formation in oophorectomized Brca1 conditional-knockout mice (Brca1co/coMMTV-CreTp53+/-) 7.
--------
These findings enhance our understanding of how ER-α signaling contributes to BRCA1-deficient mammary tumors and provide evidence suggesting that targeted inhibition of ER-α signaling may be useful for the prevention of BRCA1-mutated breast cancer.
--------
In these studies, the contribution of estrogen signaling to BRCA1-deficient mammary tumor formation was assessed by examining mammary tumor formation in oophorectomized Brca1 conditional-knockout mice (Brca1co/coMMTV-CreTp53+/-) 7.
--------
Here, using an endogenous-tumor-bearing Brca1-mutant mouse model, we found that inhibition of estrogen signaling could be a useful strategy for reducing BRCA1-associated breast cancer.
--------
Conflicting results have been obtained using the same mouse model (Brca1co/coMMTV-creTp53+/-), with one study showing that oophorectomized Brca1-mutant mice exhibit a much lower tumor incidence than sham controls, and a second showing that treatment of Brca1-mutant mice with tamoxifen produces no chemopreventive effect against mammary cancer development 7, 8.
--------
These findings suggest that preventing estrogen signaling is not an effective strategy for controlling BRCA1-deficient breast cancer, regardless of ER status.
--------
In addition, spontaneously developed mammary tumors from Brca1-mutant mice expressed considerable amounts of ER-α, but did not display the phosphorylated form of ER-α, suggesting that estrogen signaling is not active or is disrupted in ER-α-positive cells and tumors.

--------
Here, we examined the effects of estrogen on the accumulation of genetic instabilities upon loss of BRCA1, and assessed the contribution of estrogen signaling to the incidence and progression of Brca1-mutated mammary tumors.
--------
One possible answer to this question is estrogen signaling, and attempts have been made to control BRCA1-deficient mammary tumors by inhibiting this signaling axis.
--------
Here, to examine the contribution of estrogen signaling to BRCA1-associated breast cancer, we tested fulvestrant (brand name, Faslodex) in Brca1-mutant mice.
--------
Here, using an endogenous-tumor-bearing Brca1-mutant mouse model, we found that inhibition of estrogen signaling could be a useful strategy for reducing BRCA1-associated breast cancer.
--------
Here, we tested the ability of fulvestrant, a different type of ER antagonist that lacks agonist activity 11, to prevent Brca1-mutant mammary tumors.
--------
To test whether inhibition of estrogen signaling prevents BRCA1-deficient breast cancer, we injected 9-month-old Brca1co/coMMTV-cre mice biweekly for 5 months with fulvestrant, which binds to the ER and promotes its degradation.
--------
These findings enhance our understanding of how ER-α signaling contributes to BRCA1-deficient mammary tumors and provide evidence suggesting that targeted inhibition of ER-α signaling may be useful for the prevention of BRCA1-mutated breast cancer.
--------
To determine whether inhibition of estrogen suppressed the progression of ER-α-positive BRCA1-associated mammary tumors, we tested the efficacy of fulvestrant using an allograft mouse model.
--------
These findings enhance our understanding of how ER-α signaling contributes to BRCA1-deficient mammary tumors and provide evidence suggesting that targeted inhibition of ER-α signaling may be useful for the prevention of BRCA1-mutated breast cancer.
--------
Our analysis of mammary tissues from non-tumor-bearing mice in the same group also showed that fulvestrant treatment significantly reduced ductal length (27% reduction) and branching (37% decrease), suggesting that inhibition of ER signaling reduces the incidence of BRCA1-associated mammary tumors in association with a decrease in epithelial cell proliferation and mammary gland rigidity.
--------
In the present study, we suppressed estrogen signaling with fulvestrant, and examined tumor initiation and progression in Brca1co/coMMTV-cre mice, which simulate human BRCA1-mutated mammary tumors.
--------
In agreement, our ChIP assays showed that DNMT1/3a/3b and the transcriptional repressive histone mark H3K27me3 are recruited to the promoter region of FOXO3 in BRCA1-low and -mutated breast cancer cell lines but not in BRCA1-competent MCF-7 cells.
--------
Collectively, these data provide evidence that FOXO3 is methylated in basal subtype breast cancers, where BRCA1 is either mutated or depleted, highlighting the importance of BRCA1 in promoting FOXO3 expression through suppressing FOXO3 methylation in luminal breast cancers.
--------
Furthermore, immunohistochemistry further suggested that FOXO3 expression was significantly associated with BRCA1 status in EZH2-positive breast cancer.
--------
BRCA1 positively regulates FOXO3 expression by restricting FOXO3 gene methylation and epigenetic silencing through targeting EZH2 in breast cancer
--------
In agreement, our result also show that BRCA1 suppresses proliferation of basal type breast cancer cell line HCC70, at least partially through FOXO3, as depletion of FOXO3 by siRNA compromised the cell proliferation suppression induced by BRCA1 overexpression.
--------
Having established that BRCA1 positively regulates FOXO3 expression through inhibiting the ability of EZH2 to mediate FOXO3 methylation and silencing in human breast cancer cells, we next examined the association between FOXO3 methylation and BRCA1 mutation status in a methylated DNA immunoprecipitation data set from familial breast tumour samples collected by kConFab (The Kathleen Cuningham Foundation Consortium for Research into Familial Breast Cancer, Melbourne, Australia).27 There are 33 samples in the cohort, 11 of which harbour the BRCA1 mutation.
--------
Mutations in BRCA1 predispose women to a higher lifetime risk of breast and ovarian cancer.29 BRCA1 is implicated in mammary epithelial cell differentiation and its deficiency is often associated with basal-like breast cancer subtype.30 Although it has been reported that BRCA1 imposes its tumour suppressive role by regulating DNA damage repair and cell cycle checkpoint, the exact reason whereby BRCA1 deficiency or mutation causes more aggressive breast cancer phenotype remains largely unknown.
--------
The results suggest that the tumour suppressive role of BRCA1 is partially achieved by regulating FOXO3 expression in breast cancer.
--------
To establish the functional significance of BRCA1–FOXO3 regulatory axis in breast cancer, we evaluated whether the anti-proliferative function of BRCA1 is mediated through FOXO3.
--------
Correlation between BRCA1 and FOXO3 expression in breast cancer cell lines
--------
These findings contribute to better understand the tumour suppressor role of BRCA1 and the regulation of another tumour suppressor FOXO3 in breast cancer, and suggest FOXO3 as a diagnostic marker and therapeutic target for BRCA1-deficient basal-like breast cancer.

--------
Past studies have reported that the FOXO3 is primarily regulated by multiple kinases that could phosphorylate FOXO3, which subsequently lead to nuclear exclusion and ubiquitination/degradation in the cytoplasm.35, 40 This study reports a novel regulatory mechanism of FOXO3 by BRCA1 in breast cancer where BRCA1 indirectly regulates FOXO3 expression through interfering with EZH2-H3K27me3 deposition onto the FOXO3 promoter and its DNA methylation.
--------
A previous study showed that BRCA1 interacts with EZH2 to inhibit its repression and the H3K27me3 on genes targeted by the PRC2 repressive complex in mouse embryonic stem and human breast cancer cells.22 We also showed recently that BRCA1 inhibits promoter methylation and chromatin silencing of FOXA1 through binding to EZH2.23 These findings raised the possibility that BRCA1 promotes FOXO3 expression through inhibiting EZH2 activity and histone lysine 27 trimethylation.
--------
RNA and protein analysis of a panel of breast cancer cell lines revealed that BRCA1 deficiency is associated with downregulation of the expression of the pleiotropic tumour suppressor FOXO3.

--------
To summarize, the current study demonstrates that BRCA1 positively regulates FOXO3 expression through inhibiting the activity of ESH2 in breast cancer, whereas depletion or mutation of BRCA1 would lead to restoration of the ability of EZH2 to recruit DNMT1/3a/3b methyltransferases and H3K27me3 histone marks, to mediate methylation and silencing of the FOXO3 gene.

Having established that BRCA1 positively regulates FOXO3 expression through inhibiting the ability of EZH2 to mediate FOXO3 methylation and silencing in human breast cancer cells, we next examined the association between FOXO3 methylation and BRCA1 mutation status in a methylated DNA immunoprecipitation data set from familial breast tumour samples collected by kConFab (The Kathleen Cuningham Foundation Consortium for Research into Familial Breast Cancer, Melbourne, Australia).27 There are 33 samples in the cohort, 11 of which harbour the BRCA1 mutation.
--------
To further affirm our results, we also investigated the correlation between BRCA1 mutation status and FOXO3 protein expression levels in human samples by immunohistochemical staining on tissue microarray constructed from 308 Korean breast cancer cases with known BRCA1 status (Figure 11a).

--------
BRCA1 represses FOXO3 promoter methylation in breast cancer
--------
Together, these data support the idea that EZH2 negatively regulates FOXO3 transcription in BRCA1-deficient breast cancer cells, whereas this EZH2 activity is repressed by BRCA1 in BRCA1-competent cells.
--------
As BRCA1 has been shown to be able to bind EZH2 and negatively regulate PRC2 complex activity,22 and as we have previously shown that both BRCA1 and DMNT3 bind to EZH2 but do not exist in the same complexes in breast cancer cells,23 these lead us to propose that BRCA1 can promote the transcription of FOXO3 indirectly through binding to EZH2 subunit of the PRC2 complex, thereby restraining its methyltransferase activity.

--------
In addition, the expression levels of FOXO3 and FOXA1 may also be useful biomarkers to molecularly classify BRCA1-mutated breast cancers.
--------
To investigate the relationship between BRCA1 and FOXO3 expression, western blot analysis was performed on a panel of five breast cancer cell lines, which include the luminal-type MCF-7 cells with wild-type-competent BRCA1 and the basal-type lines HCC70, MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-436 and MDA-MB-468 expressing either low or mutated BRCA1.

--------
This suggests that BRCA1 hypermethylation or BRCA1 germline alteration without concurrent LOH is rare in early-stage TNBC specimens and when observed may be due to tissue sampling limitations.

Using the survival analysis, we found that CCNE1, NPBWR1, A2ML1 and TTK might act critical functions in the oncogenesis and progression of BRCA1/2-mutant breast cancer, reflected by their diagnostic efficacy for BRCA1/2 mutations and prognostic value as well.
--------
This demonstrated specific expression alternation of genes in our study, including TTK, EXO1, TICRR (TOBPPI interacting checkpoint and replication regulation) and so on, would be closely associated with BRCA1/2 mutations, providing a clue for further understanding the certain characteristic of BRCA1/2-mutant BC (for example, increased risk of distant metastasis and more aggressive nature) (Wang et al., 2018) and clarifying its pathogenesis.
--------
In our analysis, CCNE1 was significantly upregulated in BRCA1/2-mutant BC, compared with wild-type BC, suggesting that BRCA1/2 genes could regulate cell cycle in tumors via CCNE1 reflected by the fact that cell cycle phase transition, especially cell cycle G1/S transition were significantly enriched in mutant breast cancer from the GSEA results.

By bioinformatic analyses including GSEA enrichment analysis (GO and KEGG), differentially expressed genes identification, PPI network, survival and diagnostic value analysis, we identified CCNE1, TTK and EXO1 might act as the potential diagnostic indicators for screening BC and BRCA1/2-mutant BC.

CCNE1, NPBWR1, A2ML1, EXO1 and TTK displayed good prognostic/diagnostic value for breast cancer and BRCA1/2-mutant breast cancer.

Moreover, among upregulated hub genes, we found many genes displayed good diagnostic efficacy for BRCA1/2-mutant breast cancer compared to wild-type breast cancer, including CCNE1, NPBWR1, A2ML1, TTK, C4orf51 (Chromosome 4 open reading frame 51) and EXO1 (Exonuclease 1), with AUC value >0.630 and P-value <0.05.

In this article, from a new perspective, we identified some novel DEGs, including CCNE1, NPBWR1, A2ML1, EXO1 and TTK, might play critical functions in the oncogenesis and progression of BRCA1/2-mutant BC, which was not been previously interpreted from a similar idea.

Results: Consensus network analysis helped to identify specific co-expressed modules that showed positive correlations with tumor stage, number of positive lymph nodes, and margin status in BRCA1/2-mutant BC but lacking correlations in BRCA1/2-wild-type BC.
--------
Furthermore, regulators cross-linking these modules include the transcription factors STAT1, IRF1, E2F7, E2F1, E2F2, FOXM1, and MYBL2 which were significantly upregulated in BRCA1-MUT BC, and E2F1, FOXM1, STAT1, ZIC3, and IRF9 upregulated in BRCA2-MUT BC.
--------
Eight hub genes, including ISG15, BUB1, and TTK, were upregulated in several BRCA1/2-mutant BC datasets and showed prognostic value in BC.
--------
In both the BRCA1-MUT and BRCA2-MUT cohorts, we found upregulated modules significantly related to immune response (the purple and brown modules, respectively), indicating that genes in these modules may have specific effects on progression and metastasis of BRCA1/2-MUT BC but no significant impact on BRCA1/2-WT BC.
--------
We found that the validated hub genes could influence metastasis of BRCA1/2-MUT BC through mechanisms including regulation of immune response, cell cycle, cell migration, and metabolic processes.
--------
In our study, the upregulated expression and prognostic value of these hub genes in BRCA1/2-mutant BC suggested that its roles in this type of breast cancer were equally noteworthy.
--------
Therefore, these validated genes are potential key hub genes and critical regulatory factors in BRCA1/2-MUT BC, which could represent new prognostic or diagnostic biomarkers and provide novel insights into the mechanisms of BRCA1/2 mutations in cancer development.
--------
For example, we found that two modules associated with immune response and cell cycle regulation were significantly correlated with clinical traits (tumor M stage and poor prognosis) in BRCA1-MUT BC, but without significant influence in WT BC, suggesting that the modules and associated genes influenced by BRCA1 mutations could regulate and cause dysfunction of the cell cycle and immune response, and thus influence the metastasis and prognosis of BRCA1-MUT BC.

Therefore, to identify the differences between BRCA1/2-MUT BC and BRCA1/2 wild-type (BRCA1/2-WT) BC, we used consensus WGCNA, an improved analysis method which was conducted in our study using a slightly different R package code on the basis of the general principles of WGCNA, thereby perform the comparison of the effect of modules on associated clinical traits between mutant and WT cancers.

For example, we found that two modules associated with immune response and cell cycle regulation were significantly correlated with clinical traits (tumor M stage and poor prognosis) in BRCA1-MUT BC, but without significant influence in WT BC, suggesting that the modules and associated genes influenced by BRCA1 mutations could regulate and cause dysfunction of the cell cycle and immune response, and thus influence the metastasis and prognosis of BRCA1-MUT BC.
--------
Results: Consensus network analysis helped to identify specific co-expressed modules that showed positive correlations with tumor stage, number of positive lymph nodes, and margin status in BRCA1/2-mutant BC but lacking correlations in BRCA1/2-wild-type BC.
--------
The turquoise and purple modules in the BRCA1-MUT group and the red, purple, blue, turquoise, black, greenyellow, and brown modules in the BRCA2-MUT group due to their correlations with clinical traits, were identified as clinically significant modules associated with carcinogenesis, progression, and metastasis of BRCA1/2-MUT BC.
--------
In both the BRCA1-MUT and BRCA2-MUT cohorts, we found upregulated modules significantly related to immune response (the purple and brown modules, respectively), indicating that genes in these modules may have specific effects on progression and metastasis of BRCA1/2-MUT BC but no significant impact on BRCA1/2-WT BC.
--------
Notably, the highly connected genes identified in our study, denoted hub genes, showed sequential changes in expression levels from TNBC to BRCA1/2-MUT BC to BRCA1/2-WT BC, suggesting close relationships between BRCA1/2 mutations and TNBC at a molecular level.
--------
Furthermore, by validation using GEO datasets and survival analysis, we identified hub genes BUB1, CCNB1, BUB1B, ISG15, KIF11, CDC20, TTK, and NCAPG, which act as important regulatory genes in the progression of BRCA1/2-MUT BC.
--------
In our study, the upregulated expression and prognostic value of these hub genes in BRCA1/2-mutant BC suggested that its roles in this type of breast cancer were equally noteworthy.

Eight hub genes, including ISG15, BUB1, and TTK, were upregulated in several BRCA1/2-mutant BC datasets and showed prognostic value in BC.

--------
In BRCA1-MUT BC, genes including BUB1, CCNB1, BUB1B, CCNA2, and TTK showed consistently upregulated expression in at least one of the validation datasets.
--------
We identified a correlation gene expression network and associated TFs in BRCA1/2-MUT BC to provide comprehensive and novel insights into the pathological mechanisms involved in BRCA1/2-MUT BC and the close relations between BRCA1/2 mutations and TNBC at a molecular level.
--------
Based on their expression levels in BRCA1-MUT BC relative to normal samples, many TFs were also significantly upregulated in the BRCA1-MUT group, including in the purple module [STAT1 (log2FC = 1.62) and IRF1 (log2FC = 1.10)] and turquoise module [E2F7 (log2FC = 3.16), E2F1 (log2FC = 2.83), FOXM1 (log2FC = 4.13), E2F2 (log2FC = 3.03), and MYBL2 (log2FC = 4.20)], suggesting a positive feedback loop in the regulation of BRCA1-associated carcinogenesis.

Consensus network analysis identified 12 consensus modules (genes not assigned to any of the modules are colored gray), including eight upregulated modules and three downregulated modules, in the BRCA1-MUT cohort compared with the WT cohort (Figures 1A,B); and 12 consensus modules including nine upregulated modules and two downregulated modules in BRCA2-MUT BC samples (Figures 1C,D; a complete module-trait heatmap is provided in Supplementary Figure 4).

In fact, promoter methylation has been reported to be a regulatory mechanism for BRCA1 expression and is associated with poor prognosis in breast cancer.25, 26 On the contrary, treatment of the luminal MCF-7 with 5'-aza-dC did not alter the expression levels of FOXA1 (Figure 6c) indicating that, in the presence of wild-type BRCA1, FOXA1 expression is not repressed by DNA methylation.
--------
Integrated analysis of the global gene methylation and expression profiles of a set of 33 familial breast tumours revealed that FOXA1 promoter methylation is inversely correlated with the transcriptional expression of FOXA1 and that BRCA1 mutation breast cancer is significantly associated with FOXA1 methylation and downregulation of FOXA1 expression, providing physiological evidence to our findings that FOXA1 expression is regulated by methylation and chromatin silencing and that BRCA1 maintains FOXA1 expression through suppressing FOXA1 gene methylation in breast cancer.
--------
This is in agreement with a previous study showing that BRCA1 binds directly to EZH2 and inhibits PRC2 activity,20 which regulated histone methylation and the DNA methylation of target genes.16 Consistent with this idea, the expression of BRCA1 could significantly upregulate FOXA1 mRNA expression in basal-like breast cancer cells, including MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-436, but not in the luminal cells, such as MCF-7 (Supplementary Figure S6).
--------
Mutations to the breast cancer susceptibility gene BRCA1 predispose women to a high lifetime risk of breast and ovarian cancer.30 BRCA1 is implicated in mammary epithelial cell differentiation and its deficiency associated with basal-like breast cancer subtype, yet the underlying mechanism involved is still not well understood.
--------
Having established that BRCA1 regulates FOXA1 methylation and silencing as well as the mechanism involved in human and MMECs, we next examined the association between FOXA1 methylation and expression in vivo in a published methylated DNA immunoprecipitation and gene expression microarray data set derived from familial breast tumour samples collected by kConFab (The Kathleen Cuningham Foundation Consortium for Research into Familial Breast Cancer, Melbourne, Australia).23 There are 33 patient samples in the cohort, 11 of which are with BRCA1 mutation.

--------
A recent study showed that BRCA1 interacts with the PRC2 protein EZH2 to negatively regulate gene expression through promoting histone H3 lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3) in mouse embryonic stem and human breast cancer cells.20 These findings raised the possibility that BRCA1 modulates FOXA1 methylation and expression through recruiting EZH2.
--------
Similar correlations between BRCA1 and FOXA1 expression were observed in a panel of breast cancer cell lines with different levels of wild-type BRCA1 (Supplementary Figure S1).
--------
It has been shown that the growth of BRCA1-deficient mouse mammary tumours is dependant on EZH2 expression.18 Conversely, EZH2 inhibition in breast cancer cell lines can cause BRCA1 nuclear exportation and inactivation.19 Crucially, BRCA1 interacts directly with EZH2 in both mouse embryonic stem cells and human breast cancer cells, functioning as a negative modulator of EZH2 activity.20
--------
The molecular phenotype of basal breast cancers has been shown to be repressed by FOXA1 expression, which is associated with the luminal phenotype.13 These findings raise the possibility that BRCA1 and FOXA1 interact at the molecular level to modulate the development of basal and luminal breast cancer subtypes.
--------
Nevertheless, the breast cancer patient gene expression microarray and methylated DNA immunoprecipitation analyses clearly show that BRCA1 mutation is significantly associated with FOXA1 gene promoter methylation and expression downregulation.
--------
These data corroborate with the hypothesis that EZH2 negatively regulates FOXA1 transcription in BRCA1-deficient breast cancer cells.

--------
To investigate the relationship between BRCA1 and FOXA1, western blot analysis was performed on a panel of six breast cancer cell lines, which include the luminal-type MCF-7 cells with wild-type BRCA1 and the basal-type lines HCC70, MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-436, SUM1315MO2 and MDA-MB-468 expressing either low or mutated BRCA121 (Figure 1a).

--------
Collectively, these results suggest that DNA methylation has a part in low FOXA1 expression in basal subtype breast cancers where BRCA1 is either mutated or depleted (Figure 6d), highlighting a role of BRCA1 in promoting FOXA1 expression through suppressing FOXA1 methylation in luminal breast cancers.
--------
This is in agreement with a previous study showing that BRCA1 binds directly to EZH2 and inhibits PRC2 activity,20 which regulated histone methylation and the DNA methylation of target genes.16 Consistent with this idea, the expression of BRCA1 could significantly upregulate FOXA1 mRNA expression in basal-like breast cancer cells, including MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-436, but not in the luminal cells, such as MCF-7 (Supplementary Figure S6).
--------
Knockdown of BRCA1 resulted in the downregulation of FOXA1 expression and enhancement of FOXA1 promoter methylation in MCF-7 breast cancer cells, whereas the reconstitution of BRCA1 in Brca1-deficent mouse mammary epithelial cells (MMECs) promoted Foxa1 expression and methylation.
--------
In this study, we show that FOXA1 expression is negatively regulated by promoter methylation and silencing, and that BRCA1 regulates FOXA1 expression through suppressing its methylation in both human breast cancer cells and MMECs.
--------
It has been suggested that BRCA1 might regulate luminal differentiation through the transcriptional activation of ER.5 BRCA1 might also regulate mammary cell fate through transcriptional activation of Notch signalling pathway.2 In addition, BRCA1 could also interact with GATA3 at its C-terminal region to repress triple-negative and basal-like breast cancer (BLBCs) associated genes, such as FOXC1. 6
--------
DNA methylation is a well-defined epigenetic mechanism for the repression of gene expression22 and BRCA1 mutation is associated with specific global DNA methylation profiles in breast cancer.23 These findings suggested that BRCA1 deficiency may lead to DNA methylation and therefore the silencing of FOXA1. To test this conjecture, we studied the extent of DNA methylation in the CpG islands located within the Foxa1 gene promoter in the Brca1-deficient mouse epithelial cells (Figure 3c).

--------
FOXA1 repression is associated with loss of BRCA1 and increased promoter methylation and chromatin silencing in breast cancer
--------
In light of these findings, collectively, our results lead us to propose a mechanistic model in which BRCA1 can promote FOXA1 transcriptional expression and thereby, breast cancer luminal subtype development through targeting EZH2 (Supplementary Figure S12).
--------
There is evidence to suggest that DNA methylation is gradually lost passively through many rounds of cell division29 and during breast epithelial cell immortalization.32 In agreement, bisulphite-converted PCR analysis showed that the FOXA1 promoter region is hypomethylated in BRCA1-positive as well as negative human breast cancer cell lines (Supplementary Figure S4).
--------
The good correlation between BRCA1 and FOXA1 expression in the panel of breast cancer cell lines led us to explore further the possibility that BRCA1 regulates FOXA1 expression.
--------
Gene promoter hypomethylation has previously been shown to be due to the prolonged passaging of cell lines and the immortalization process29 and could explain for the inefficient derepression of FOXA1 expression in BRCA1-deficient human breast cancer cell lines after 5'-aza-dC treatment.
--------
RNA and protein analysis of a panel of breast cancer cell lines revealed that BRCA1 deficiency is associated with the downregulation of FOXA1 expression.

--------
EZH2 mediates the trimethylation of histone 3 lysine 27 (H3K27me3), which serves as an epigenetic code for subsequent recruitment of PRC1, DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) and histone deacetylases, resulting in chromatin condensation and transcription suppression.15 In addition, EZH2 can also directly interact with DNMTs and regulate the methylation of EZH2-target genes,16 although these interactions might be cell-type specific.17 Recently, EZH2 has also been functionally linked with BRCA1 in breast cancer.

TOP2A and ATAD5 correlate with BRCA1 mRNA in BC and CRC, whereas LMNB2 correlates with BRCA1 only in CRC
--------
Using a gene co-expression tool (cBioPortal), we observed TOP2A and ATAD5 levels correlate (Spearman’s correlation>0.6) with BRCA1 in BC and CRC, whereas LMNB2 correlates with BRCA1 in CRC, suggesting tissue-specific BRCA1 interactions.

TOP2A and ATAD5 levels correlated with BRCA1 expression in BC and CRC, whereas LMNB2 correlated with BRCA1 in CRC, suggesting tissue-specific BRCA1 interactions.

We previously demonstrated that loss of BRCA1 can contribute to the aggressiveness of HRAS-driven BC in vitro and in vivo [44].
--------
We identified some genes that correlated with BRCA1 expression in both BC and CRC, such as TOP2A (DNA Topoisomerase IIα) (Figure 5B) and ATAD5 (ATPase Family AAA Domain Containing 5) (Figure 5C).
--------
Initial evidence suggests that BRCA1 is a key negative modulator of PRC2 and that loss of BRCA1 inhibits stem cell differentiation and enhances an aggressive breast cancer phenotype by affecting PRC2 function [20].

To investigate radiation effects on BRCA1-deficient cells, we knocked down BRCA1 expression in MCF7 breast cancer cells using small interfering RNA (siRNA) and assessed survival of the resulting BRCA1-knockdown cells using MTT [3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide] assays following exposure to increasing doses of irradiation (Fig. 1A).
--------
Herein, we show that radiotherapy is a viable approach for proactively treating the progression of BRCA1-associated breast cancer.
--------
A comparison of baseline and progressed tumor volumes in treated (Fig. 2C, red line) and non-treated (Fig. 2C, black line) Brca1-mutant tumor-bearing mice showed that mammary tumor volumes increased 2.39-fold after irradiation and more than 7 times in the absence of treatment.

The other study confirmed the promising synergistic effect between these compounds, highlighting that the combination enhanced the Brca1 expression levels in TNBC and inhibited both the migratory ability of TNBC cell lines and the cell survival by inducing the histone acetylation of the Brca1 promoter, and downregulation of T47D cells in the gene [217].

Along with activation of the Akt pathway, estrogen promoted EMT and proliferation in Brca1-deficient mammary tumor cells, which prompted us to test whether pharmaceutical inhibition of Akt activity has any effect on Brca1-deficient cell proliferation and tumor progression.
--------
p18−/− mice in the Balb/c background developed ER-positive luminal-type mammary tumors [37] whereas p18−/−;Brca1+/− double mutant mice formed ER-negative basal-like mammary tumors [19].
--------
These results suggest that the deletion of Brca1 enhances the tumor-initiating potential of tumor cells, which is consistent with our previous finding that loss of Brca1 activates EMT and induces ER-negative basal-like mammary tumors with enriched CSCs [23].
--------
A genetic model system with three mouse strains, one that develops ER-positive mammary tumors (p18 single deletion) and the others that develop ER-negative tumors (p16;Brca1 and p18;Brca1 compound deletion), human BRCA1 mutant breast cancer patient-derived xenografts, and human BRCA1-deficient and BRCA1-proficient breast cancer cells were used to determine the role of estrogen in activating epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), stimulating cell proliferation, and promoting ER-negative mammary tumor initiation and metastasis.
--------
To further investigate the role of estrogen in Brca1-deficient mammary tumor progression, we isolated a highly metastatic p18−/−;Brca1MGKO tumor cell line from a mammary tumor (tumor B) that was metastasized to lung.
--------
To determine the role of estrogen in Brca1-deficient mammary tumorigenesis, we transplanted Brca1-proficient and Brca1-deficient mammary tumor cells into MFPs of NSG mice with or without estrogen (17β-estradiol, E2) supplement.

--------
RB is a major target for genomic disruption in BRCA1 mutant human breast cancers, and most BRCA1-deficient BLBCs carry a dysfunctional INK4-CDK4/6-RB pathway [9, 33, 34].
--------
We report in this paper that estrogen enhances the number of breast CSCs in Brca1-deficient, ER-negative mammary tumors independent of ER.
--------
This investigation will support to develop strategies to inhibit estrogen synthesis and to target AKT for treatment of BRCA1-deficient basal-like breast cancers.
--------
This study not only reveals the molecular mechanisms underlying the role of estrogen in promoting development and progression of ER-negative basal-like breast cancers but also identifies a druggable AKT pathway that is activated by estrogen in BRCA1-deficient breast cancers.

--------
We previously discovered that deletion of cell cycle inhibitors p16Ink4a (p16) or p18Ink4c (p18) is required for development of Brca1-deficient basal-like mammary tumors, and that mice lacking p18 develop luminal-type mammary tumors.
--------
As the majority of BRCA1-deficient tumors contain a fraction of cells that are positive for VIM and/or other mesenchymal markers, and only a small number of human BRCA1-deficient tumors, i.e. metaplastic breast cancers, are predominantly composed of mesenchymal/VIM-positive cells [16–19, 24, 39, 44, 46], we therefore focused on type 1 p18−/−;Brca1MGKO tumor cells.
--------
We further discovered that estrogen activates the Akt pathway in Brca1-deficient mammary tumor cells independent of ER, and that pharmaceutical inhibition of Akt activity suppresses EMT and cell proliferation preventing Brca1-deficient tumor progression.

--------
IHC and western blot analysis confirmed the expression of Brca1 and ERα in regenerated mammary tumors by p18−/− tumor cells and lack of Brca1 and ERα in regenerated tumors by p18−/−;Brca1MGKO cells with E2 supplement (Additional file 3: Figure S3 and Additional file 4: Figure S4B, C).
--------
These results suggest that the deletion of Brca1 enhances the tumor-initiating potential of tumor cells, which is consistent with our previous finding that loss of Brca1 activates EMT and induces ER-negative basal-like mammary tumors with enriched CSCs [23].

--------
In summary these results demonstrate that transplantation of representative p18−/−;Brca1MGKO and p16−/−;Brca1MGKO tumor cells into MFPs of NSG mice generate reproducible ER-negative tumors, which build a model system to study BRCA1-deficient mammary tumor development and progression.
--------
These data are supported by the findings in both mouse [23] and human mammary tumors [24, 44] that most BRCA1 mutant tumors are VIM positive and some of them are predominantly composed of VIM-positive cells.
--------
We then selected a BRCA1 mutant, ER-negative human breast cancer cell line, SUM149, in which p16 is deleted and VIM is expressed in 10–30% of total cells [35, 47–49].
--------
Importantly, we demonstrated that estrogen activates EMT in a subset of ER-negative and Brca1-deficient mammary tumor cells, promoting their properties in tumor initiation and progression.
--------
This cell line shares many genetic (p16/p18 and Brca1 loss-of-function mutation) and phenotypical (ER negative with a subset of cells exhibiting EMT features) similarities with p16;Brca1 and p18;Brca1 mutant murine mammary tumor cells.

--------
All widely used BRCA1 mutant breast cancer cell lines have deletions in either RB or p16 [35, 36], reflecting the importance of inactivation of the INK4-CDK4/6-RB pathway in the proliferation of BRCA1-deficient tumor cells.
--------
To determine the role of estrogen in Brca1-deficient mammary tumorigenesis, we transplanted Brca1-proficient and Brca1-deficient mammary tumor cells into MFPs of NSG mice with or without estrogen (17β-estradiol, E2) supplement.

--------
Downregulation of AKT1 in Brca1-mutant mice reduces mammary tumor formation
--------
Previous studies have reported that mammary tumors spontaneously generated from Brca1-alterd mice can be orthotopically transplanted into female mice without losing their original phenotype, gene expression profile, or sensitivity to anticancer agents 9, 30.
--------
Inhibition of AKT decreased the levels of phosphorylated mTOR, Rb, cyclin D1 and S6, as well as the levels of cyclin D1 and PCNA (proliferating cell nuclear antigen) in both cell lines, suggesting that suppression of AKT activity reduced the activities/levels of various proteins related to cell-cycle progression and proliferation in BRCA1-deficient breast cancer cells.
--------
To determine whether AKT contributes to BRCA1-deficient mammary tumor formation, we generated cohorts of Brca1co/co, Brca1co/coAkt1+/-, Brca1co/coMMTV-Cre and Brca1co/coMMTV-Cre Akt1+/- mice, and examined tumor formation.
--------
Taken together, these results suggest that inhibition of AKT activity in Brca1-mutant mammary tumors significantly suppresses tumor progression.
--------
Next, we further analyzed whether inhibition of AKT was capable of exerting anticancer efficacy against tumor cells in addition to its apparent ability to prevent BRCA1-related breast cancer.
--------
However, increases in AKT phosphorylation induced by the loss of BRCA1 were identified not only in hyperplastic mammary glands, but also in adenocarcinomas from Brca1-mutant mice and estrogen-insensitive mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) (Fig. 1G and 1H), suggesting differential contributions of ER-α and AKT to the initiation and progression of BRCA1-associated mammary tumor.
--------
Previously, we showed that estrogen signaling contributes to BRCA1-deficient mammary tumors and demonstrated that its inhibition may be useful for the prevention of BRCA1-mutated breast cancer 32.

Results of the current study based on this mouse simulation system suggest that inhibition of AKT could be a useful strategy for both preventing and treating BRCA1-associated breast cancer.
--------
A haploinsufficiency of Akt1 in Brca1-mutant mouse model significantly decreased mammary tumor formation from 54% in Brca1co/coMMTV-Cre mice to 22% in Brca1 co/coMMTV-Cre Akt1+/- mice.
--------
We herein show that AKT plays an important role in the tumorigenesis caused by the loss of BRCA1, and provide evidence suggesting that targeting AKT could be therapeutically relevant for preventing and treating BRCA1-associated breast cancer.

Using a Brca1-mutant mouse model, we examined the contribution of AKT to the incidence and growth of Brca1-mutated mammary tumors.

Inhibition of AKT suppresses the initiation and progression of BRCA1-associated mammary tumors
--------
Our findings enhance our understanding of the involvement of AKT signaling in BRCA1-deficient mammary tumors and provide preclinical evidence that targeted AKT inhibition is a potential strategy for the prevention and therapeutic management of BRCA1-associated breast cancer.
--------
To increase the potential clinical efficacy of AKT inhibition against BRCA1-associated breast cancer, it would be helpful to distinguish potential responders from non-responders before initiation of treatment.
--------
In the present study, we tested the ability of the AKT inhibitor MK-2206 to suppress the activity of AKT in Brca1co/coMMTV-Cre mice, which develop tumors that mimic human BRCA1 mutation-related mammary tumors, and evaluated the clinical applicability of these agents by examining tumor initiation and progression in vivo.

Our findings enhance our understanding of the involvement of AKT signaling in BRCA1-deficient mammary tumors and provide preclinical evidence that targeted AKT inhibition is a potential strategy for the prevention and therapeutic management of BRCA1-associated breast cancer.

--------
At 16 months of age, significantly fewer Brca1co/coMMTV-Cre mice with a haploinsufficiency of Akt1 exhibited mammary tumor formation (22%; 6 of 27) compared to Brca1co/coMMTV-Cre mice with WT Akt1 (54%; 15 of 28), suggesting that AKT activity is important for the formation of Brca1-mutant mammary tumors.
--------
In addition, estrogen receptor-α (ER-α) is highly expressed in the premalignant mammary gland and during initiation stages of tumorigenesis in the Brca1-mutant mouse, although its expression is gradually diminished during mammary tumor progression 28.
--------
Our findings enhance our understanding of the involvement of AKT signaling in BRCA1-deficient mammary tumors and provide preclinical evidence that targeted AKT inhibition is a potential strategy for the prevention and therapeutic management of BRCA1-associated breast cancer.

Taken together, our results indicate that AKT inhibition decreases mammary tumor growth and increases survival in mice with BRCA1-associated mammary tumors.

We herein show that AKT plays an important role in the tumorigenesis caused by the loss of BRCA1, and provide evidence suggesting that targeting AKT could be therapeutically relevant for preventing and treating BRCA1-associated breast cancer.

LYN Is Required for Growth of BRCA1-Deficient Mammary Tumor Cells
--------
To further investigate the involvement of specific BRCA1 functional domains in the regulation of the PIN1-LYN axis, and the possibility that different clinically relevant BRCA1 mutants may have different effects on this axis, we re-expressed either the wild-type BRCA1 or clinically relevant BRCA1 missense mutants (C61G in the RING domain, L1407P in the CC motif, and A1708E in the BRCT domain) (Anantha et al., 2017) in the HCC1937 human BRCA1-deficient breast cancer cell line.
--------
To demonstrate a direct functional link between PIN1 expression and LYN activity, we knocked down PIN1 in primary mouse Brca1 null cells (Figure 5A) and cells from a BRCA1 mutant human breast cancer cell line (HCC1937) (Figure 5B) and the BRCA1 mutant PDX (Figure 5C).
--------
Use of two short hairpins targeting human LYN (Figure 3E) demonstrated that LYN knockdown in human breast cancer cells also significantly impaired cell growth in the BRCA1-mutated HCC1937 human breast cancer cell line (Figure 3F) and in cells from a BRCA1 mutant breast cancer patient-derived xenograft (PDX) (Figure 3G).
--------
To determine whether Brca1 mutant cell growth depends on the activation of the c-KIT signaling pathway, primary mouse Brca1 mutant mammary tumor cells transduced with lentiviruses expressing either one of two shRNAs against c-Kit (shKit1 and shKit2) or a control shRNA (shScr) were analyzed.
--------
Use of two short hairpins targeting human LYN (Figure 3E) demonstrated that LYN knockdown in human breast cancer cells also significantly impaired cell growth in the BRCA1-mutated HCC1937 human breast cancer cell line (Figure 3F) and in cells from a BRCA1 mutant breast cancer patient-derived xenograft (PDX) (Figure 3G).

--------
In BRCA1-dysfunctional breast cancers, LYN activity is upregulated by a prolyl isomerase (PIN1) that is normally repressed by BRCA1.
--------
We next assessed whether the PIN1-LYN regulatory mechanism is likely to be more widely applicable than just to BRCA1 breast cancer.
--------
To further investigate the involvement of specific BRCA1 functional domains in the regulation of the PIN1-LYN axis, and the possibility that different clinically relevant BRCA1 mutants may have different effects on this axis, we re-expressed either the wild-type BRCA1 or clinically relevant BRCA1 missense mutants (C61G in the RING domain, L1407P in the CC motif, and A1708E in the BRCT domain) (Anantha et al., 2017) in the HCC1937 human BRCA1-deficient breast cancer cell line.

--------
Therefore, LYN kinase depletion suppresses Brca1 mammary tumor cell growth both in vitro and in vivo.
--------
Given our findings that BRCA1 loss results in PIN1 upregulation, we hypothesized that even in sporadic breast cancers not linked to germline BRCA1 mutation but that have low BRCA1 levels through other mechanisms, levels of BRCA1 and PIN1 expression would be inversely correlated.
--------
We have previously demonstrated that Brca1 mutation-associated breast cancers originate from luminal ER− progenitors (Molyneux et al., 2010) and that c-KIT and LYN are expressed in mouse Brca1 mammary tumors (Regan et al., 2012).

Since inactivation of INK4-CDK4/6-RB pathway in mice induces mammary luminal type tumors with little effect on EMT activation 7, 15, 20, 47, p18;Brca1 and p18;Gata3 mutant mice provide us a unique opportunity to investigate and compare the role of Brca1 and Gata3 loss in activation of EMT in breast cancers under a genetically intact p53 background.
--------
In the present study, we determined and compared the EMT phenotype in mammary tumors developed in mice deficient for Brca1 or Gata3 under the same p18 deficient background.
--------
By using these mutant mice along with human BRCA1 deficient as well as proficient breast cancer tissues and cells, we investigated and compared the role of Brca1 and Gata3 loss in the activation of EMT in breast cancers.
--------
Our finding that suggests Brca1 protects the Gata3 promoter from methylation is, at least, one of the important mechanisms by which BRCA1 regulates GATA3 transcription, though it remains to be investigated that whether BRCA1 directly transactivates GATA3 and how BRCA1 interacts with DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) and EZH2 to control transcription of GATA3. Our findings also suggest that DNMT inhibitors can be used to induce GATA3 and its mediated differentiation for treatment of BRCA1-deficient breast cancers.
--------
Though it has been reported that loss of function of BRCA1 in breast cancers or cell lines enhances the expression of several EMT inducing transcription factors including SLUG 5, TWIST 20, FOXC1/C2 21, and reduces the expression of a few EMT suppressing transcription factors, such as FOXA1 22, 23, FOXO3 24, 25, none of these transcription factors has been identified as downstream mediators of BRCA1 in the regulation of EMT in mammary tumor development and progression.
--------
Expression of BRCA1 is positively correlated with that of GATA3 in human breast cancers
--------
Our finding, for the first time, demonstrates that GATA3 functions downstream of BRCA1 to suppress EMT in controlling mammary tumor initiation and metastasis.
--------
Purpose: Functional loss of BRCA1 is associated with poorly differentiated and metastatic breast cancers that are enriched with cancer stem cells (CSCs).
--------
By using these mutant mice along with human BRCA1 deficient as well as proficient breast cancer tissues and cells, we investigated and compared the role of Brca1 and Gata3 loss in the activation of EMT in breast cancers.
--------
Results: We discovered that BRCA1 and GATA3 expressions were positively correlated in human breast cancer.
--------
Among the transcription factors upregulated by BRCA1 deficiency, overexpression of these EMT-TF induces EMT, and knockdown of SLUG, FOXC1, or FOXC2 in either BRCA1 mutant (SUM149 or SUM1315) or BRCA1 deficient (MDA-MB-231) breast cancer cell lines promotes expression of luminal and epithelial markers in vitro5, 21.
--------
Since inactivation of INK4-CDK4/6-RB pathway in mice induces mammary luminal type tumors with little effect on EMT activation 7, 15, 20, 47, p18;Brca1 and p18;Gata3 mutant mice provide us a unique opportunity to investigate and compare the role of Brca1 and Gata3 loss in activation of EMT in breast cancers under a genetically intact p53 background.
--------
Taking into consideration of the similar potential of p18mt;Brca1+/- and p18mt;Gata3+/- tumor cells in promoting tumor initiation and metastasis, these results indicate that in breast cancer cells Gata3 deficiency functions similarly with Brca1 deficiency in activation of EMT and promotion of tumorigenesis and metastasis.
--------
Our finding that suggests Brca1 protects the Gata3 promoter from methylation is, at least, one of the important mechanisms by which BRCA1 regulates GATA3 transcription, though it remains to be investigated that whether BRCA1 directly transactivates GATA3 and how BRCA1 interacts with DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) and EZH2 to control transcription of GATA3. Our findings also suggest that DNMT inhibitors can be used to induce GATA3 and its mediated differentiation for treatment of BRCA1-deficient breast cancers.
--------
These results suggest that Gata3 promoter is hypermethylated in Brca1 deficient cells relative to that in Brca1 proficient cells, which confirms our findings derived from human breast cancer samples and cells.
--------
Our finding identifies GATA3 as the first transcription factor that functions downstream of BRCA1 to suppress EMT in breast cancers.
--------
Prompted by the findings derived from mouse models, we then employed human breast cancer samples to determine the correlation of BRCA1 and GATA3.
--------
These results suggest that Gata3 promoter is hypermethylated in Brca1 deficient cells relative to that in Brca1 proficient cells, which confirms our findings derived from human breast cancer samples and cells.

Notably, both primary and regenerated Brca1 deficient mammary tumors were also composed of predominantly CD24+CD29high cells, and Brca1 deficient mammary tumor cells harbored drastically enhanced potential for tumor initiation and metastasis 20, 50.

Loss of function of BRCA1 in breast cancer cells enhances the expression of several EMT inducing transcription factors (EMT-TFs) including SLUG 5, TWIST 20, FOXC1/C2 21, and inversely reduces the expression of a few of the EMT suppressing TFs, such as FOXA1 22, 23, FOXO3 24, 25.
--------
Our finding demonstrates that GATA3 functions downstream of BRCA1 to suppress EMT in controlling mammary tumor initiation and metastasis.
--------
We discovered that GATA3 functions downstream of BRCA1 to suppress EMT in controlling mammary tumor initiation and metastasis.
--------
Together with the finding that mammary tumors developed in p18 deficient mice are Brca1- and Gata3-positive well-differentiated tumors (Figure 1, and Reference 7, 15, 20), these results indicate that Brca1 protects the Gata3 promoter from methylation to maintain Gata3 transcription in the suppression of mammary tumors.
--------
In the present study, we demonstrated that BRCA1 mutation is associated with GATA3 promoter hypermethylation and reduced GATA3 expression in human breast cancer samples.
--------
GATA3 functions downstream of BRCA1 to suppress EMT in breast cancer
--------
Given the direct regulation of GATA3 by BRCA1 shown above, and EMT-suppressive function of ectopic GATA3 in cell lines 26-28, we hypothesized that depletion of Gata3 in mice resulted in poorly differentiated mammary tumors with the induction of EMT which phenocopied Brca1-deficient tumors.
--------
We transduced p18-/-;Brca1MGKO tumor cells with pBabe-Empty and pBabe-Gata3 respectively, and found that ectopic Gata3 restored expression of Cdh1, a target of Gata3, but inhibited expression of Vim and EMT-TFs including Slug, Snail, and Twist1 (Figure 6A, B), which was stimulated by loss of Brca1 in mammary tumors (Figure 1A, Figure S1).
--------
If a transcription factor primarily functions downstream of Brca1 controlling EMT in breast cancers, genetically loss of or gain of function of this transcription factor in mice with the same genetic background should produce similar EMT phenotype with Brca1 deficient mice, and restoration or removal of the function of the transcription factor should eliminate Brca1 deficient EMT phenotype in mammary tumors, in addition to the regulation of the transcription factor by BRCA1 in vitro.
--------
These results indicate that depletion of BRCA1 in breast cancer cell lines enhances methylation of the GATA3 promoter thereby repressing its transcription.
--------
To determine if Gata3 affects Brca1 deficient mammary tumor metastasis, we transplanted Empty- and Gata3-expressing p18-/-; Brca1MGKO tumor cells into MFPs of NSG mice.
--------
Though it has been reported that loss of function of BRCA1 in breast cancers or cell lines enhances the expression of several EMT inducing transcription factors including SLUG 5, TWIST 20, FOXC1/C2 21, and reduces the expression of a few EMT suppressing transcription factors, such as FOXA1 22, 23, FOXO3 24, 25, none of these transcription factors has been identified as downstream mediators of BRCA1 in the regulation of EMT in mammary tumor development and progression.
--------
Most BRCA1-deficient breast cancers carry a dysfunctional INK4-CDK4/6-RB pathway 13, 40, 41, All widely used BRCA1 mutant breast cancer cell lines have deletions in either RB or p16 42, 43.
--------
These data indicate that BRCA1 mutation is associated with GATA3 promoter hypermethylation and reduced GATA3 expression in human breast cancer samples.
--------
Our finding that suggests Brca1 protects the Gata3 promoter from methylation is, at least, one of the important mechanisms by which BRCA1 regulates GATA3 transcription, though it remains to be investigated that whether BRCA1 directly transactivates GATA3 and how BRCA1 interacts with DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) and EZH2 to control transcription of GATA3. Our findings also suggest that DNMT inhibitors can be used to induce GATA3 and its mediated differentiation for treatment of BRCA1-deficient breast cancers.

--------
Among the transcription factors upregulated by BRCA1 deficiency, overexpression of these EMT-TF induces EMT, and knockdown of SLUG, FOXC1, or FOXC2 in either BRCA1 mutant (SUM149 or SUM1315) or BRCA1 deficient (MDA-MB-231) breast cancer cell lines promotes expression of luminal and epithelial markers in vitro5, 21.
--------
By using these mutant mice along with human BRCA1 deficient as well as proficient breast cancer tissues and cells, we investigated and compared the role of Brca1 and Gata3 loss in the activation of EMT in breast cancers.
--------
Most BRCA1-deficient breast cancers carry a dysfunctional INK4-CDK4/6-RB pathway 13, 40, 41, All widely used BRCA1 mutant breast cancer cell lines have deletions in either RB or p16 42, 43.
--------
Prompted by the finding that Gata3 functions downstream of Brca1 in suppressing EMT in breast cancers, we then examined if ectopic Gata3 in Brca1-deficinet tumor cells suppresses their potential for tumor initiation and metastasis.
--------
In this paper, we found that BRCA1 and GATA3 expressions are positively correlated and that BRCA1 mutation is associated with the enhanced methylation of the GATA3 promoter and reduced expression of the GATA3 gene in human breast cancers.
--------
Together, these clinical findings are consistent with the results from our mice cohorts; thereby suggesting an opportunity to use murine systems to further explore how BRCA1 interacts with GATA3 to control EMT in breast cancers.
--------
Together with the finding that mammary tumors developed in p18 deficient mice are Brca1- and Gata3-positive well-differentiated tumors (Figure 1, and Reference 7, 15, 20), these results indicate that Brca1 protects the Gata3 promoter from methylation to maintain Gata3 transcription in the suppression of mammary tumors.
--------
Pathological analysis revealed that p18mt;Gata3+/- mammary tumors were highly heterogeneous and with various degrees of whorls and clusters of spindle-shaped cells, which are typical morphological characteristics of mesenchymal cells and also frequently observed in p18mt;Brca1+/-mammary tumors (Figure 4C, 5A, and Ref 7).
--------
Our finding that suggests Brca1 protects the Gata3 promoter from methylation is, at least, one of the important mechanisms by which BRCA1 regulates GATA3 transcription, though it remains to be investigated that whether BRCA1 directly transactivates GATA3 and how BRCA1 interacts with DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) and EZH2 to control transcription of GATA3. Our findings also suggest that DNMT inhibitors can be used to induce GATA3 and its mediated differentiation for treatment of BRCA1-deficient breast cancers.
--------
These results confirm that BRCA1 is required to maintain GATA3 expression in human breast cancer cells.
--------
Among the transcription factors upregulated by BRCA1 deficiency, overexpression of these EMT-TF induces EMT, and knockdown of SLUG, FOXC1, or FOXC2 in either BRCA1 mutant (SUM149 or SUM1315) or BRCA1 deficient (MDA-MB-231) breast cancer cell lines promotes expression of luminal and epithelial markers in vitro5, 21.
--------
To determine the similarity of cellular phenotype of Brca1 and Gata3 deficient tumor cells, we generated five p18mt;Brca1+/-, five p18mt;Gata3+/-, and three p18mt tumor cell lines, each of which was derived from a primary mammary tumor developed in an individual mouse.
--------
We discovered that mammary tumors generated by Gata3-expressing cells produced significantly less metastatic nodules in the lung when compared with the mammary tumors initiated by Empty-expressing cells (Figure 6I-J), suggesting that ectopic Gata3 inhibits the metastatic potential of Brca1 deficient mammary tumor cells.
--------
If a transcription factor primarily functions downstream of Brca1 controlling EMT in breast cancers, genetically loss of or gain of function of this transcription factor in mice with the same genetic background should produce similar EMT phenotype with Brca1 deficient mice, and restoration or removal of the function of the transcription factor should eliminate Brca1 deficient EMT phenotype in mammary tumors, in addition to the regulation of the transcription factor by BRCA1 in vitro.

--------
We examined EMT markers including Vim, Fn, E-cad, and EMT-TFs and found that all EMT markers positively stained in p18mt;Brca1+/- primary mammary tumors and its related metastasis were also detected in p18mt;Gata3+/-counterparts.
--------
Importantly, when compared with p18mt tumors, both p18mt;Gata3+/-and p18mt;Brca1+/-mammary tumors more frequently metastasized to the lungs, and the lung metastasis were also enriched with mesenchymal-like cells.
--------
Finally, we have demonstrated that loss of p16 or p18 rescues the premature senescence of MECs caused by Brca1 deficiency [11, 31, 33, 34] and that loss of Brca1 in p16- or p18-deficient mice leads to the development of mammary tumors resembling BLBC accompanied by features of EMT [11, 31].
--------
We also found that inhibition of PDGFR or PKCα activity efficiently killed BRCA1-deficient human breast cancer cells and that expression of BRCA1 was inversely related to that of PDGFRβ and PKCα in human breast cancer samples.
--------
Furthermore, Pdgfrβ mRNA levels in p18−/−;Brca1+/− mammary tumors strongly correlated with EMT and stem cell signatures (Fig. 1e, f, and Additional file 2B, C, D), in agreement with the data derived from IHC and published elsewhere [31, 59].
--------
Importantly, these results confirm the role of Brca1 in suppressing EMT in a mammary tumor cell autonomous manner.
--------
To confirm the role of BRCA1 in controlling Pdgfrβ-Pkcα signaling, we overexpressed WT BRCA1 in two BRCA1-mutant breast cancer cell lines, HCC1937 and SUM149, and a basal-like cell line, MDA-MB231.
--------
Moreover, we queried the mRNA expression of genes in the METABRIC 1584 breast cancer sample sets and found a significant inverse correlation between BRCA1 with PDGFRβ and PKCα mRNA levels (Fig. 7g).

--------
In addition, p18−/−;Brca1+/− mammary tumors were enriched with cancer stem cells [31, 59] and significantly more metastatic than p18−/− tumors (Fig. 1a).
--------
Our work offers the first genetic and biochemical evidence that PDGFRβ-PKCα signaling is repressed by BRCA1, which establishes PDGFRβ-PKCα signaling as a therapeutic target for BRCA1-deficient breast cancers.
--------
To confirm the cytotoxic effects of inhibition of PDGFR and PKCα on BRCA1-deficient human breast cancer cells, we screened six widely used cell lines including two BRCA1 WT luminal lines, T47D and MCF7; two BRCA1 WT basal lines, MDA-MB231 and BT20; and two BRCA1 mutated lines, HCC1937 and SUM149.
--------
By using these mutant mice and human BRCA1-deficient and proficient breast cancer tissues and cells, we tested if there exists a druggable target in BRCA1-deficient breast cancers.
--------
Notably, Pdgfrβ and Ck14 doubly positive tumor cells were also detected in lung metastases of p18−/−;Brca1MGKO and p16−/−;Brca1MGKO mammary tumors (Fig. 2a, b, and Additional file 3), which demonstrated that the metastases were derived from Brca1-deficient basal-like mammary tumors with an increased Pdgfrβ expression.
--------
We also found that inhibition of PDGFR or PKCα activity efficiently killed BRCA1-deficient human breast cancer cells and that expression of BRCA1 was inversely related to that of PDGFRβ and PKCα in human breast cancer samples.

We previously discovered that the majority of p18−/− mice developed CK8+ and ER+ luminal type mammary tumors while most p18−/−;Brca1+/− mice formed mammary tumors that were ER− and CK5+ basal-like tumors expressing mesenchymal markers as well as EMT-TFs [11, 28, 31].

Overall, BRCA1 is required for the induction of apoptosis in response to spindle poison (just to mention here that paclitaxel and docetaxel have not exactly the same mechanism of action), particularly in breast cancer cells.

--------
One investigation showed that loss of BRCA1 expression may predict shorter time to progression in metastatic breast cancers treated with taxanes; however, no relationship with the clinical tumour response was observed and no genotyping of the BRCA1 status was performed [6].
--------
Since the BRCA1 protein is involved in the repair of DNA damage, including double-strand breaks induced by radiotherapy and chemotherapy, advanced breast cancers too large to be treated upfront with breast-conserving surgery could be more chemo- or radiosensitive in mutation carriers than in non-carriers [2].
--------
In fact, recently Rottenberg et al. [9] studying the responses of spontaneous BRCA1 and P53-deficient mammary tumours arising in conditional mouse mutations to doxorubicin, docetaxel and cisplatin showed that the response of individual cases varies, but eventually all become resistant to the maximum tolerable dose of doxorubicin or docetaxel but still respond well to cisplatin even after multiple treatments in recurrences.
--------
Preclinical studies indicated that BRCA1 is required for paclitaxel sensitivity in breast cancer cell lines.
--------
Because BRCA1 mutation occurs frequently in TNBC and diverse CAF phenotypes exist in cancer, we next performed scRNA-seq analysis to compare the characteristics of CAF between patients with TNBC BRCA1 mutation type (MT) and wild type (WT) (Fig. 2A).
--------
Based on abundant cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) and frequent mutation of breast cancer-associated 1 (BRCA1) in TNBC, the characteristics of CAFs in TNBC patients with BRCA1 mutation compared to wild-type were investigated using single-cell analysis.

BRCA1 mutation promotes sprouting angiogenesis in inflammatory cancer-associated fibroblast of triple-negative breast cancer
--------
Depletion of Gata3, like that of Brca1, promoted DNA damage accumulation in breast cancer cells in vitro and in basal-like breast cancers in vivo.
--------
Given that the remaining wild-type Brca1 allele was lost in CK5-positive basal-like cells, not in CK5-negative cells, in Brca1 heterozygous mammary tumors [35], and that GATA3 functions downstream of BRCA1 to suppress breast cancer [32], it will be interesting to determine if LOH of Gata3 occurs in certain groups of Gata3 heterozygous mammary tumor cells.
--------
Depletion of Gata3, like that of Brca1, promoted DNA damage accumulation in breast cancer cells in vitro and in basal-like breast cancers in vivo.
--------
We confirmed that Gata3+/+;Brca1+/+ mammary tumor cells expressed high levels of GATA3 and Brca1+/− (p18−/−;Brca1+/−) or Gata3+/− (p18−/−;Gata3+/−) mammary tumor cells expressed very weak GATA3 (Fig. 3e), as we previously described [31, 32].
--------
Since estrogen is an intrinsic source of the induction of DNA damage in mammary epithelial and tumor cells under physiological condition, we then transplanted p18−/− (Gata3+/+;Brca1+/+), p18−/−;Gata3+/− (Gata3-deficient), and p18−/−;Brca1+/− (Brca1-deficient) mammary tumor cells into MFPs of the recipient mice who were simultaneously administered estrogen or vehicle.
--------
In this study, we discovered that depletion of Gata3, like that of Brca1, impairs DNA damage repair in breast cancer cells in vitro and in vivo.

--------
Since p18−/− luminal tumor cells proliferate very slowly in vitro and weakly generate luminal tumors when transplanted in vivo [32], we utilized a few Gata3+/+;Brca1+/+ luminal tumor cell lines isolated from MMTV-PyMT mammary tumors (Fig. 3e) (this study and reference [31]).
--------
Given that the remaining wild-type Brca1 allele was lost in CK5-positive basal-like cells, not in CK5-negative cells, in Brca1 heterozygous mammary tumors [35], and that GATA3 functions downstream of BRCA1 to suppress breast cancer [32], it will be interesting to determine if LOH of Gata3 occurs in certain groups of Gata3 heterozygous mammary tumor cells.
--------
Reconstitution of Gata3 in Brca1-deficient mammary tumor cells restores the HR efficiency of Brca1-deficient cells and improves DNA damage repair in mammary tumorigenesis.
--------
We found that in response to estrogen (17β-estradiol, E2) Gata3+/− and Brca1+/− mouse mammary tumor cells expressed higher levels of γH2AX than Gata3+/+;Brca1+/+ tumor cells (Fig. 3g, i).

We previously reported that GATA3 functions downstream of BRCA1 to suppress aberrant differentiation in breast cancer.
--------
We previously demonstrated that in mice loss of p18Ink4c (p18), an INK4 family cell cycle inhibitor, promotes MEC proliferation and induces Gata3 and Brca1-proficient luminal type mammary tumors, whereas depletion of either Brca1 or Gata3 on top of p18 null background leads to the development of BLBCs with activation of EMT [12, 25, 31, 32, 35].

--------
As a control, we conducted a similar treatment for Brca1+/− (p18−/−;Brca1+/−) mouse mammary tumor cells and also observed a significant increase of γH2AX in Brca1+/− cells relative to that in Gata3+/+;Brca1+/+ cells (Fig. 3f, h).
--------
We previously demonstrated that loss of p18, a cell cycle inhibitor, in mice induces luminal-type mammary tumors, whereas depletion of either Brca1 or Gata3 in p18 null mice leads to basal-like breast cancers (BLBCs) with activation of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT).
--------
Reconstitution of Gata3 improves DNA damage repair in Brca1-deficient mammary tumor cells and tumorigenesis
--------
This result is in line with the findings derived from primary p18−/−;Gata3+/− and p18−/−;Brca1+/− mammary tumors (Fig. 1), suggesting Gata3-mediated DNA damage repair may not be as efficient as Brca1-mediated repair in tumor development.
--------
As a control, we conducted a similar treatment for Brca1+/− (p18−/−;Brca1+/−) mouse mammary tumor cells and also observed a significant increase of γH2AX in Brca1+/− cells relative to that in Gata3+/+;Brca1+/+ cells (Fig. 3f, h).
--------
Besides, we identified some marker genes for BRCA1 deficient mammary tumors, which may serve as candidate targets for diagnosis, prognosis and/or treatment of BRCA1 associated breast cancers.
--------
Another genetic alteration frequently occurred in BRCA1 related breast cancer is the TP53 loss, which is also observed in the BRCA1-deficient mouse mammary tumors 10.
--------
Intratumor heterogeneity of BRCA1-defecient mammary tumors
--------
About 78.2% of the BRCA1-deficient mammary tumors do not express ERα or PR, though about 60% of the tumors showed detectable level of ERBB2 (Figure S2A, Table S4).
--------
In consideration of the high mutation frequency of Trp53 in BRCA1 deficient mammary tumors, and the much longer period for formation of Br53Ts than BrTs (Figure 1A), the mesenchymal like BrTs may generate and accumulate Trp53 mutation during the tumorigenesis process.
--------
The observation of great intertumor heterogeneity among BRCA1-deficient mammary tumors propelled us to posit whether such phenomenon is ascribed to the intratumor heterogeneity among tumor cells.
--------
Here, we applied dropseq to analyze pair-matched mammary gland cells and mammary tumor cells from two Brca1 mutant mice (termed as MT1 and MT2 hereafter).
--------
Taken together, these results manifested that the BRCA1-deficient mammary tumors bear great intertumor heterogeneity.
--------
To further dissect the molecular features of the mammary tumors, we checked the relative activation levels of several key pathways involved in mammary development and tumorigenesis, and/or biological functions of BRCA1 (Figure 2C and Figure S3A).
--------
In this study, we found near 80% of the BRCA1-deficient mouse mammary tumors are ER and PR double negative, while 60% of the tumors show detectable expression level of ERBB2 (Figure S2A), which is inconsistent with the human BRCA1 related breast cancers 16.
--------
In summary, our current study deciphered the inter- and intra-tumor heterogeneity of BRCA1 deficient mouse mammary tumors, and described the landscape of the mammary tumorigenesis induced by loss of BRCA1, which provides a useful resource for better understanding of BRCA1 deficiency induced mammary tumorigenesis.

Furthermore, from candidate markers for BRCA1 mutant tumors, we discovered and validated one oncogene Mrc2, whose loss could reduce mammary tumor growth in vitro and in vivo.
--------
Both human individuals with heredofamilial BRCA1 mutations and BRCA1-deficient mouse models stochastically develop mammary tumors 8, 42-44, indicating multiple factors might contribute to the oncogenic process and lead to great heterogeneity of the tumors.

Dissecting the heterogeneity and tumorigenesis of BRCA1 deficient mammary tumors via single cell RNA sequencing

Methods: To comprehensively elucidate the heterogeneity of BRCA1 deficient mammary tumors and the underlying mechanisms for tumor initiation and progression, we conducted bulk and single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) on both mammary gland cells and mammary tumor cells isolated from Brca1 knockout mice.

--------
While all the Br53T1 cells together with a few Br53T2 cells are clustered as Tum2, the rest Br53T2 cells are classified into Tum1, which indicates there might be some similarity of transcription regulation among Brca1/Trp53 double mutant mammary tumors.
--------
We have previously established a mouse model carrying mammary specific knockout of Brca1 (MMTV-Cre; Brca1fl/fl), which spontaneously develops mammary tumors in a stochastic manner 10.
--------

Molecular subtyping of BRCA1-defecient mammary tumors
--------
To further study the heterogeneity of BRCA1-deficient mammary tumors, we collected 23 tumors from two previously established mouse models, where MMTV-Cre driven loss of BRCA1 (MMTV-Cre; Brca1fl/fl) specifically develops mammary tumors (BrTs) in 1-1.5 year, while combination of Trp53 mutation (MMTV-Cre; Brca1fl/fl;Trp53fl/+) could greatly accelerate the tumorigenesis (Figure 1A).
--------
In our mouse models, the Brca1 mutation in luminal cells results in mammary tumors formation 10, 54.

--------
Besides, we identified some marker genes for BRCA1 deficient mammary tumors, which may serve as candidate targets for diagnosis, prognosis and/or treatment of BRCA1 associated breast cancers.
--------
And loss of BRCA1 induces mammary tumors in a stochastic manner.
--------
Another genetic alteration frequently occurred in BRCA1 related breast cancer is the TP53 loss, which is also observed in the BRCA1-deficient mouse mammary tumors 10.
--------
To address this, we resorted to the Fluidigm C1 platform based scRNA-seq to decipher the composition of BRCA1-deficient mammary tumor cells, as well as the mammary luminal cells, in which loss of BRCA1 initiates the tumorigenesis (Figure S5, and Table S5).
--------
This raises the hypothesis that the timing of TRP53 loss may determine the subtype of BRCA1-deficient mouse mammary tumors.
--------
In this study, we found near 80% of the BRCA1-deficient mouse mammary tumors are ER and PR double negative, while 60% of the tumors show detectable expression level of ERBB2 (Figure S2A), which is inconsistent with the human BRCA1 related breast cancers 16.
--------
In this study, we explored the inter- and intra-tumor heterogeneity of BRCA1 deficient mouse mammary tumors.
--------
Based on the whole transcriptomes of the 23 BRCA1-deficient mammary tumors, four subgroups are identified via hierarchal clustering, and termed as mesenchymal like, luminal like I and II (Lum I and Lum II), and mixed types respectively because of their differential expression patterns of mammary basal/luminal lineage markers and epithelial/mesenchymal cell markers (Figure 2A-B).
--------
To further study the heterogeneity of BRCA1-deficient mammary tumors, we collected 23 tumors from two previously established mouse models, where MMTV-Cre driven loss of BRCA1 (MMTV-Cre; Brca1fl/fl) specifically develops mammary tumors (BrTs) in 1-1.5 year, while combination of Trp53 mutation (MMTV-Cre; Brca1fl/fl;Trp53fl/+) could greatly accelerate the tumorigenesis (Figure 1A).
--------
In this study, we performed bulk RNA-seq and other experiments to elucidate the intertumor heterogeneity among BRCA1 deficient mammary tumors, and scRNA-seq of more than 20000 mammary cells and tumor cells to reveal the intratumor heterogeneity and gene expression variations during the mammary tumorigenesis process.
--------
We further checked the expression level of Mrc2 in the 4 subtypes of BRCA1-deficient mouse mammary tumors, and found Mrc2 was highly expressed in the mesenchymal-like tumors when compared to other 3 subtypes (Figure S10C).
--------
More studies are required to pinpoint whether the expression of ERBB2 plays a driver or passenger role in the BRCA1-deficient mouse mammary tumors.
--------
Another genetic alteration frequently occurred in BRCA1 related breast cancer is the TP53 loss, which is also observed in the BRCA1-deficient mouse mammary tumors 10.
--------
Besides, we identified some marker genes for BRCA1 deficient mammary tumors, which may serve as candidate targets for diagnosis, prognosis and/or treatment of BRCA1 associated breast cancers.
--------
The consequences of HMMR overexpression against a Brca1-mutant background expose the initial interplay of these alterations that may promote development of BRCA1-associated breast cancer.
--------
Therefore, HMMR expression in breast tumors correlates with gene sets predicted to influence BRCA1-associated breast cancer risk.
--------
In this work, we analyze human germline and tumor data, and perform molecular and cellular studies in mouse models with conditional overexpression of HMMR and loss of BRCA1 and p53 in mammary epithelial cells, to decipher the biological foundation of increased risk of BRCA1-associated breast cancer.

--------
These data indicate that a relatively modest rise in the level of HMMR expression in mammary epithelial cells increases the penetrance of Brca1-mutant mammary tumors, which parallels the association of the rs299290-C eQTL with an increased risk of BRCA1-associated breast cancer.
--------
The premalignant gene expression profiles observed in Blg-Cre;Brca1f/f;Trp53+/− mice further suggested that HMMR overexpression amplifies perturbations that are present at the origin of BRCA1-associated breast cancer.
--------
These data indicate that a relatively modest rise in the level of HMMR expression in mammary epithelial cells increases the penetrance of Brca1-mutant mammary tumors, which parallels the association of the rs299290-C eQTL with an increased risk of BRCA1-associated breast cancer.
--------
The cumulative evidence presented above suggested that HMMR overexpression increases BRCA1-associated breast cancer risk by further perturbing foundational process(es) that are altered in this type of cancer.

These data indicate that a relatively modest rise in the level of HMMR expression in mammary epithelial cells increases the penetrance of Brca1-mutant mammary tumors, which parallels the association of the rs299290-C eQTL with an increased risk of BRCA1-associated breast cancer.
--------
The interplay between HMMR overexpression and loss of p53 remains to be examined, but it is expected to be connected to loss of BRCA1, since most BRCA1-associated breast cancers show TP53 mutations53.
--------
These observations are consistent with frequent overexpression of AURKA and HMMR in BRCA1-mutant breast cancer cell lines and tumors10,11, and suggest that abnormal earlier localization of ARPC2 at mitotic spindle poles is mediated by overexpression of HMMR that triggers AURKA overactivation.
--------
The hyaluronan-mediated motility receptor (HMMR, also known as RHAMM) interacts with BRCA1 to regulate cell division and apicobasal polarization of mammary epithelial cells10,11, and is a potential modifier of BRCA1-associated breast cancer risk11,12.

--------
Modification of BRCA1-associated breast cancer risk by HMMR overexpression
--------
The consequences of HMMR overexpression against a Brca1-mutant background expose the initial interplay of these alterations that may promote development of BRCA1-associated breast cancer.
--------
Common genetic variation in HMMR was proposed to be associated with breast cancer risk in carriers of pathological variants in BRCA1, but not in BRCA211,12.
--------
The interplay between HMMR overexpression and loss of p53 remains to be examined, but it is expected to be connected to loss of BRCA1, since most BRCA1-associated breast cancers show TP53 mutations53.
--------
These results were also found to be consistent with frequent overexpression of HMMR in BRCA1-mutant breast cancer cell lines and tumors10,11, and with impaired formation of MCF10A acini upon concurrent depletion of BRCA1 and HMMR11.
--------
Interestingly, BRCA1-associated breast cancers show active NF-κB-driven transcriptional programs47, and BRCA1-deficiency causes persistent NF-κB signaling48.
--------
The effect of hyaluronan-mediated motility receptor (HMMR) expression in BRCA1-associated breast cancer risk remains unknown.
--------
It is not, therefore, surprising for the BRCA1/2 cases in our series overexpressing PARP1 (non-cleaved), which appears to be the reactive response of cells when DNA damage repair by BRCA gene is defective, and has been recently reported in BRCA1 mutant breast cancer cell lines and BRCA1-mutated BC cases [28].

We found statistically significant differences in all of these secreted metabolites between the BRCA1 mutated and non-mutated BC cell lines, except for the adenine metabolite (Table 2).
--------
BC cell lines segregate into three different metabolic clusters based on their BRCA1 genotype
--------
Our results revealed phenotypic similarities based on the metabolic data that make it possible to distinguish between cell lines depending on the presence of alterations linked to BRCA1. We also provide evidence of common metabolic features that were identified despite the strong heterogeneity observed among the BC cell lines.

This chromosomal gain was present in only 28.6% of the BRCA1 non-mutated TNBC, 26.7% of the unscreened TNBC, 13.6% of the luminal B, 19.0% of the HER2+ and 0% of the luminal A breast cancers.

BRCA1-mutant HCC1937 breast cancer cells showed increased sensitivity to etoposide as compared to BRCA1-wild-type expressing isogenic cells, as shown by a clonogenic assay.
--------
Antisense inhibition of BRCA1 expression in HBL100, MCF7 and T47D breast cancer cells led to increased sensitivity to mitomycin C and cisplatin, but not to doxorubicin and etoposide, as determined by a clonogenic assay. Similar results were obtained on the BRCA1-mutated HCC1937 breast cancer cell line. This effect was attributed to premature senescence of the chemosensitive cells.

BRCA1-mutant HCC1937 breast cancer cells were more sensitive to vinorelbine than BRCA1-proficient MCF7 and MDA-MB-468 cells; when docetaxel was used, HCC1937 were similarly sensitive as compared to MCF7, and less sensitive than MDA-MB-468 (MTT test). Transfection of the wild-type BRCA1 in HCC1937 cells rendered resistance to vinorelbine, but slightly increased sensitivity to docetaxel. The effect of vinorelbine was at least in part attributed to the modulation of the apoptotic response.
--------
shRNA-directed inhibition of BRCA1 expression in MCF7 and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells decreased cytotoxicity of paclitaxel. Breast cancer cell lines carrying BRCA1 mutation (HCC1937 and MDA-MB-436) also demonstrated low sensitivity to paclitaxel.

The elevated expression of (phosphorylated) BRCA1 in cytoplasm or nucleus, before or after treatment, may be associated with the prognosis and further studies are needed to develop this approach as diagnostic assay in BC.
--------
In addition, we used etoposide, as a DNA-damaging reagent, to validate its effect on BRCA1 protein regulation, and shed light on BRCA1 expression patterns in representative cell line models of the different BC types with or without etoposide treatment.
--------
By evaluating cytoplasmic BRCA1 protein levels, we were able to distinguish three aggressive BC subtypes with BRCAness characteristics.
--------
In order to determine whether and how etoposide regulates the protein levels of BRCA1 in BC cells, we exposed a panel of five selected cell lines to etoposide, compared the results to untreated control cells, and then stained the cells with the specific, reliable, and reproducible MS110 antibody directed against phosphorylated Ser1423 BRCA1.

We performed tandem mass spectrometry-based proteomics of secretomes and exosome-like extracellular vesicles from BRCA1-deficient and BRCA1-proficient murine breast tumor models to identify extracellular protein biomarkers, which can be used as an adjunct to current diagnostic modalities in patients with BRCA1-deficient breast cancer.
--------
Further support was provided by our in silico analysis showing that BRCA1 candidate proteins, when mapped to mRNA transcripts, could cluster BRCA1- and BRCA2-related breast cancer cases.

Given that 53BP1 deficiency protects from breast cancer associated with BRCA1 mutations and the loss of RNF8 impairs 53BP1 recruitment to DSB-flanking sites (11), we examined the role of RNF8 in BRCA1-mutant breast cancer.
--------
Interestingly, RNF8 plays an important role in the recruitment of 53BP1 to DSB-flanking sites (11,37) and the loss of 53BP1 protects Brca1-mutant mouse models from mammary tumorigenesis (14), hence we used MDA-MB-231 cells deficient for RNF8, BRCA1 or both (Figure 2a), and examined the effect of RNF8 deficiency on the formation of 53BP1 foci in BRCA1-mutant human breast cancer cells.
--------
This highlights the dependence of BRCA1 mutated breast cancer cells on RNF8 for survival.

Interestingly, RNF8 plays an important role in the recruitment of 53BP1 to DSB-flanking sites (11,37) and the loss of 53BP1 protects Brca1-mutant mouse models from mammary tumorigenesis (14), hence we used MDA-MB-231 cells deficient for RNF8, BRCA1 or both (Figure 2a), and examined the effect of RNF8 deficiency on the formation of 53BP1 foci in BRCA1-mutant human breast cancer cells.
--------
Here, we show that RNF8 deficiency is synthetic lethal for human BRCA1-mutant breast cancer cells and protects Brca1-mutant preclinical mouse models from mammary tumorigenesis.
--------
Crucially, expression of mouse Rnf8 significantly reduced the elevated levels of DNA damage observed in shRNF8 MDA-MB-436 cells (Supplementary Figure S3i, j), further supporting the role of RNF8 in maintaining genomic stability in BRCA1 mutant breast cancer cells.
--------
Mouse models with mutations in Brca1 in mammary epithelial cells have a high risk of developing mammary tumors (18,31), and while Rnf8−/− mice develop lymphomas, they also display an increased risk for mammary tumorigenesis (17,32).
--------
Contrasting with the elevated risk of mammary tumorigenesis in Brca1-mutant females, Rnf8−/−;WAP-Cre;Brca1−/− females were remarkably protected from developing spontaneous mammary tumors, and there was no difference in mammary tumor-free survival when comparing double-mutant females with RNF8 mutant or wildtype controls (Figure 1A).

--------
RNF8-deficiency protects against BRCA1 mutant breast cancer and restrain in vitro and in vivo growth of BRCA1 mutant cancer cells
--------
Given that 53BP1 deficiency protects from breast cancer associated with BRCA1 mutations and the loss of RNF8 impairs 53BP1 recruitment to DSB-flanking sites (11), we examined the role of RNF8 in BRCA1-mutant breast cancer.
--------
In order to examine the effect of dual loss of Brca1 and Rnf8 on breast cancer, we crossed mice that carry a Brca1-null mutation in mammary epithelial cells(18) (WAP-Cre;Brca1flox5-6,flox5-6; referred to as WAP-Cre;Brca1−/−) with Rnf8−/− mice (17), and generated cohorts of double mutant (Rnf8−/−;WAP-Cre;Brca1−/−), single mutant (Rnf8−/− or WAP-Cre;Brca1−/−) and wildtype (WT) females.
--------
Given that BRCA1 mutations are associated with defects in HR-mediated repair of DSBs (3,4), we examined RNF8 expression in HR-deficient or proficient breast cancers.
--------
Mechanistically, our data indicate that RNF8 deficiency in BRCA1-mutant breast cancer cells potentiates the levels of R-loops and replication stress, leading to TRCs, increased genomic instability and eventually cell death.
--------
Contrasting with the elevated risk of mammary tumorigenesis in Brca1-mutant females, Rnf8−/−;WAP-Cre;Brca1−/− females were remarkably protected from developing spontaneous mammary tumors, and there was no difference in mammary tumor-free survival when comparing double-mutant females with RNF8 mutant or wildtype controls (Figure 1A).
--------
RNF8 deficiency in human BRCA1-mutant breast cancer cells was found to promote R-loop accumulation and replication fork instability, leading to increased DNA damage, senescence, and synthetic lethality.
--------
Using a mouse model for BRCA1-mutant breast cancer, we demonstrated that genetic deletion of Rnf8 in the mammary epithelial cells of Brca1 mutant female mice remarkably reduces their risk for mammary tumorigenesis.
--------
Together, our data generated using GFP-dRNH1 and S9.6 immunofluorescence, R-loop dot blot assay, DRIP-Seq and DRIP-qPCR reveal that loss of RNF8 increases R-loop levels in BRCA1-proficient breast cancer cells, and that dual loss of RNF8 and BRCA1 further exacerbates the accumulation of R-loop structures at multiple genomic loci.
--------
Interestingly, RNF8 plays an important role in the recruitment of 53BP1 to DSB-flanking sites (11,37) and the loss of 53BP1 protects Brca1-mutant mouse models from mammary tumorigenesis (14), hence we used MDA-MB-231 cells deficient for RNF8, BRCA1 or both (Figure 2a), and examined the effect of RNF8 deficiency on the formation of 53BP1 foci in BRCA1-mutant human breast cancer cells.

We report that RNF8 ubiquitylates XRN2 to facilitate its recruitment to R-loop-prone genomic loci and that RNF8 deficiency in BRCA1-mutant breast cancer cells decreases XRN2 occupancy at R-loop-prone sites, thereby promoting R-loop accumulation, transcription-replication collisions, excessive genomic instability, and cancer cell death.
--------
We identified for the first time that β-hCG expression is linked to BRCA1 status and its overexpression is seen in BRCA1 mutated breast cancer cells, BRCA1 conditional knockout mouse breast cancer tissues and BRCA1 floxed basal cell carcinoma (BCC) tissues.
--------
BRCA1 regulation on β-hCG: a mechanism for tumorigenicity in BRCA1 defective breast cancer
--------
Probably this is the reason why only some of the breast cancer tissues express β-hCG24, 25 in a BRCA1 defective or BRCA1 deficient such as BRCA1 hyper-methylated condition.
--------
Further, β-hCG promotes migration and invasion predominantly in BRCA1 mutant breast cancer cells.
--------
We report a high expression of β-hCG in BRCA1 mutated breast cancer cell line which was demonstrated in vitro and in vivo.
--------
To address this, two BRCA1 conditional knockout mice models (WAP-Cre; BRCA1KO/CO and MMTV-Cre; BRCA1KO/CO) were developed as reported in our previous study.18 Mammary tumor formation in WAP-Cre; BRCA1KO/CO was confirmed by NMR bio imager.
--------
All the above observations clearly indicate that the loss of BRCA1 induces β-hCG in breast cancers.
--------
All these observations clearly indicate that β-hCG induces the migratory and invasive potential by promoting the process of EMT more specifically in BRCA1 defective than BRCA1 wild-type breast cancer cells.
--------
Also, wild-type but not mutant BRCA1 transcriptionally regulates the expression of β-hCG and knockdown of wild-type BRCA1 induces β-hCG in different breast cancer cell lines.
--------
Here, we demonstrate that β-hCG can promote tumor progression by inducing TGFβRII, specifically and selectively in BRCA1 defective breast cancer cells.
--------
BRCA1 & β-hCG in BRCA1 defective breast cancer
--------
Interestingly, stable overexpression of β-hCG in BRCA1 mutant but not wild-type breast cancer cells results in the formation of spheres even on monolayer cultures.
--------
Next, we analyzed whether knockdown of BRCA1 could induce β-hCG in BRCA1 wild-type breast cancer cells.
--------
We identified for the first time that β-hCG expression is linked to BRCA1 status and its overexpression is seen in BRCA1 mutated breast cancer cells, BRCA1 conditional knockout mouse breast cancer tissues and BRCA1 floxed basal cell carcinoma (BCC) tissues.
--------
Also, wild-type but not mutant BRCA1 transcriptionally regulates the expression of β-hCG and knockdown of wild-type BRCA1 induces β-hCG in different breast cancer cell lines.
--------
BRCA1 & β-hCG in BRCA1 defective breast cancer
--------
Knockdown of BRCA1 induces β-hCG in different breast cancer cell lines
--------
We identified for the first time that β-hCG expression is linked to BRCA1 status and its overexpression is seen in BRCA1 mutated breast cancer cells, BRCA1 conditional knockout mouse breast cancer tissues and BRCA1 floxed basal cell carcinoma (BCC) tissues.
--------
Next, we analyzed whether knockdown of BRCA1 could induce β-hCG in BRCA1 wild-type breast cancer cells.
--------
BRCA1 regulation on β-hCG: a mechanism for tumorigenicity in BRCA1 defective breast cancer
--------
We identified for the first time that β-hCG expression is linked to BRCA1 status and its overexpression is seen in BRCA1 mutated breast cancer cells, BRCA1 conditional knockout mouse breast cancer tissues and BRCA1 floxed basal cell carcinoma (BCC) tissues.
--------
Due to the high expression of β-hCG, we hypothesized that β-hCG might induce tumorigenicity in BRCA1 mutated breast cancer.
--------
All these observations clearly indicate that β-hCG induces the migratory and invasive potential by promoting the process of EMT more specifically in BRCA1 defective than BRCA1 wild-type breast cancer cells.
--------
We identified for the first time that β-hCG expression is linked to BRCA1 status and its overexpression is seen in BRCA1 mutated breast cancer cells, BRCA1 conditional knockout mouse breast cancer tissues and BRCA1 floxed basal cell carcinoma (BCC) tissues.
--------
The mechanism explaining how ER signaling can contribute to worsened BC progression in BRCA1/BRCA2 mutation carriers is unknown; however, preclinical data demonstrated estrogen-dependent progression of mammary tumorigenesis in BRCA1-defficient cells [29,30].
--------
Further studies have shown that the truncated variants of ATM and CHEK2 are more closely associated with estrogen receptor (ER)-positive BC, while BARD1, BRCA1, BRCA2, PALB2, RAD51C, and RAD51D are more closely related to ER-negative BC (29).
--------
Germline deletion of Brca1 activates Tgfβ signaling and EMT with enhanced expression of Tgfβr2 in mammary tumor cells
--------
Further, we find that some of the Brca1 deficient mammary tumors are CL [3, 33, 51] and that Brca1 deficiency induces basal-like mammary tumors with activation of EMT [18, 19], which is recently confirmed by an independent group [52, 53].
--------
Thus, we next limited our analysis to basal-like breast cancers, and again found a tendency for enhanced EMT/CL-like features in BRCA1 basal-like tumors, however, these differences were not statistically significant when compared to BRCA1 Wt tumors.
--------
This study reveals for the first time that a targetable TGFβR signaling pathway is directly activated by BRCA1-deficiency in the induction of EMT in breast cancer progression.
--------
These results imply a possible negative correlation between Brca1 and Tgfβr2 in mouse mammary tumors.
--------
These data demonstrate that specific deletion of Brca1 in p18 null mammary epithelia induces a malignant mammary tumor phenotype with EMT features.
--------
BRCA1 and TGFβR2 expression levels are inversely related in human breast cancers.
--------
BRCA1 deficient breast cancers are aggressive and chemoresistant due, in part, to their enrichment of cancer stem cells that can be generated from carcinoma cells by an epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT).
--------
Therefore, our results might suggest a context where Tgfβr2 might contribute to malignancy in human TNBC and reveal, for the first time, that a targetable TGFβR signaling pathway is directly activated by BRCA1-deficiency in the induction of EMT in breast cancers.
--------
Prompted by these observations in mouse models and prior studies showing enhanced expression of TGFβR2 in CSC-enriched BLBC cells [14, 15], we examined the relationship between BRCA1 with TGFβR2 mRNA levels in human breast cancer sample sets [3, 29, 30].
--------
Loss of Brca1 in p16 or p18 deficient mice activates EMT and induces BLBCs, whereas, loss of p18 induces luminal type mammary tumors [18–20, 22].
--------
Loss of function of BRCA1 promotes EMT in mammary tumors through activation of TGFβR2 signaling pathway
--------
BRCA1 depletion enhances tumor initiation potential and promotes TGFβ-mediated EMT activation in breast cancer cells
--------
Together, these illustrate that loss of Brca1 in breast cancer cells enhances the CSC population and its property in tumor initiation.
--------
Specific deletion of Brca1 in mammary epithelia enhances Tgfβr2 expression and activates EMT in mammary tumors
--------
Further, we find that some of the Brca1 deficient mammary tumors are CL [3, 33, 51] and that Brca1 deficiency induces basal-like mammary tumors with activation of EMT [18, 19], which is recently confirmed by an independent group [52, 53].
--------
Here we expand on these studies by showing Brca1 alters the expression of Tgfβr2 to elevate Tgfβ signaling and EMT in breast cancer cells.
--------
BRCA1 and TGFβR2 expression levels are inversely related in human breast cancers
--------
These results indicate that the deletion of Tgfβr2 inhibits the metastatic potential of Brca1 deficient mammary tumor cells.
--------
To identify the molecular determinants for activation of EMT in Brca1 deficient mammary tumors in an unbiased manner, we performed microarray analysis.
--------
We discovered that heterozygous germline deletion, or epithelia-specific deletion of Brca1 in mice, activates Tgfβr2 signaling pathways in mammary tumors.
--------
Further, we find that some of the Brca1 deficient mammary tumors are CL [3, 33, 51] and that Brca1 deficiency induces basal-like mammary tumors with activation of EMT [18, 19], which is recently confirmed by an independent group [52, 53].
--------
The gain was detected in 30% (20/67) of the TNBC without identified BRCA1 mutation, in 36% (14/38) of the HER2+ BC cases, in 17% (35/201) of the luminal A cases and in 43% (43/101) of the luminal B cases.
--------
This chromosomal gain was present in only 28.6% of the BRCA1 non-mutated TNBC, 26.7% of the unscreened TNBC, 13.6% of the luminal B, 19.0% of the HER2+ and 0% of the luminal A breast cancers.
--------
This suggests that inflammasome inhibition could serve as a therapeutic target for the treatment of BRCA1‐associated breast cancer.
--------
It is known that metastatic dormancy complicates the treatment of breast cancer, as surgical excision of primary tumors results in the acceleration of metastatic tumors.[qv: 47] Our findings suggest that the interference of inflammasome activation could protect BRCA1 mutant breast cancer patients from metastatic recurrence after resecting primary tumors.
--------
Blocking Inflammasome Activity Ameliorates Brca1 Mutant Mammary Tumor Recurrence and Metastasis
--------
As indicated above, BRCA1 deficiency impairs mitophagy, which suggests that more damaged mitochondria accumulate in BRCA1 mutant breast cancer cells under mitochondrial stress.
--------
These results also provide more evidence to support recent findings that anti‐inflammatory treatment reduces the incidence of early metastatic relapse in breast cancer patients and decreases tumor growth in mice models for dormancy.[qv: 47,48] Interestingly, our result shows that Brca1 mutant‐associated tumor microenvironment is different from that of Trp53 mutant‐associated type.
--------
In this study, we seek to determine the mechanism by which BRCA1 is involved in mitophagy and its impact on therapeutic treatment of BRCA1‐associated breast cancer.
--------
Although a recent study has indicated that multiple Fanconi anemia pathway genes including BRCA1 are required for mitophagy,[qv: 39] its underlying mechanism remains poorly defined, and the relationship of defective mitophagy with BRCA1‐associated breast cancer development is unknown.
--------
BRCA1 deficiency causes oxidative stress and inflammasome activation, which creates a tumor‐associated microenvironment, thereby promoting breast cancer development.
--------
Mitochondria are dynamic organelles, which continually change shape through the combined action of fission, fusion, and movement along cytoskeletal tracks.[qv: 22] Our results indicate that expression of MFN1/2 was elevated in shBRCA1 cells compared to shCtrl cells in the absence of CCCP treatment (Figure S2D, Supporting Information), suggesting that BRCA1 might regulate mitochondrial dynamics in breast cancer cells.
--------
In this study, upregulated inflammasome activation enriches TAMs' recruitment to suppress CD8+ T cell activation in Brca1 mutant mammary tumors; thus, inhibition of inflammasome activation could postpone tumor relapse and block lung metastasis after surgically removing primary cancers.
--------
However, little is known about how BRCA1 relates to mitophagy in response to mitochondrial damage and how defects in mitophagy contribute to BRCA1‐associated breast cancer.
--------
Our findings demonstrate that BRCA1 deficiency impairs mitochondrial function and mitophagy through AMP‐activated protein kinase (AMPK)‐mediated mitochondrial fission and induces inflammasome activation, which then promotes metastasis of Brca1 mutant mammary tumor.
--------

--------
However, little is known about how BRCA1 relates to mitophagy in response to mitochondrial damage and how defects in mitophagy contribute to BRCA1‐associated breast cancer.
--------
We previously demonstrated that mice with mammary gland (MG)‐specific deletion of Brca1 exon 11 (Brca1flox/flox; MMTV‐Cre) spontaneously developed mammary tumors.[qv: 17] To explore the function of BRCA1 in cytoplasm, we carried out a genome‐wide unbiased approach to analyze gene expression by RNA sequencing (RNA‐Seq) in both Brca1 mutant (MT) and wild‐type (WT) MGs from Brca1flox/flox; MMTV‐Cre, and Brca1flox/flox mice, respectively.
--------
Although a recent study has indicated that multiple Fanconi anemia pathway genes including BRCA1 are required for mitophagy,[qv: 39] its underlying mechanism remains poorly defined, and the relationship of defective mitophagy with BRCA1‐associated breast cancer development is unknown.
--------
BRCA1 Deficiency Impairs Mitophagy and Promotes Inflammasome Activation and Mammary Tumor Metastasis
--------
This study uncovers the function of BRCA1 in regulating mitophagy and provides a rational approach for treating BRCA1 mutant breast cancer with inflammasome inhibitors.
--------
Our findings demonstrate that BRCA1 deficiency impairs mitochondrial function and mitophagy through AMP‐activated protein kinase (AMPK)‐mediated mitochondrial fission and induces inflammasome activation, which then promotes metastasis of Brca1 mutant mammary tumor.
--------
To establish the effect of BRCA1 on inflammasome activation in mammary cells, we analyzed IL‐1β secretion and caspase 1 activation in MCF10A cells with detectable inflammasome‐associated components, compared to several breast cancer cell lines (Figure S8, Supporting Information).
--------
In this study, we seek to determine the mechanism by which BRCA1 is involved in mitophagy and its impact on therapeutic treatment of BRCA1‐associated breast cancer.
--------
As indicated above, BRCA1 deficiency impairs mitophagy, which suggests that more damaged mitochondria accumulate in BRCA1 mutant breast cancer cells under mitochondrial stress.
--------
This study uncovers the function of BRCA1 in regulating mitophagy and provides a rational approach for treating BRCA1 mutant breast cancer with inflammasome inhibitors.
--------
Recent results have suggested that BRCA1-associated basal-like breast cancers originate from luminal progenitor cells instead of basal stem cells (10,11).
--------
Here we develop genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs) of BRCA1-deficient breast cancer that permit rapid introduction of putative drivers by either retargeting of GEMM-derived embryonic stem cells, lentivirus-mediated somatic overexpression or in situ CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene disruption.
--------
To determine if tumors from these two new mouse models reflected the basal-like subtype typical for human BRCA1-deficient breast cancer, we performed RNA-sequencing on 22 WB1P tumors and 7 tumors from B1P mice injected with Lenti-Cre, and compared their expression profile to tumors from the KB1P mouse model and a mouse model of luminal breast cancer (WapCre;Cdh1F/F;PtenF/F, WEP; 25), using a three-gene signature that distinguishes the PAM50 subtypes26.
--------
Here, the authors develop genetically engineered mouse models of BRCA1-deficient breast cancer that allow highthroughput in vivo perturbation of candidate driver genes, validating drivers Myc, Met, Pten and Rb1, and identifying MCL1 as a collaborating driver whose targeting can impact efficacy of PARP inhibition.
--------
Interestingly, a small number of losses were retained, including the Rb1-associated loss on chromosome 14, further supporting Rb1 as a collaborating driver in MYC-driven BRCA1-deficient mammary tumors.
--------
To study the contribution of MYC overexpression to BRCA1-associated mammary tumorigenesis, we initially employed the K14Cre;Brca1F/F;Trp53F/F (KB1P) mouse model20, in which epithelium-specific loss of BRCA1 and p53 leads to the formation of mammary tumors and, to a lesser extent, other epithelial tumors including skin tumors.

--------
Thus, WapCreC-driven deletion of Rank delays the onset and in 25% of cases even completely prevents the development of Brca1;p53 mutation-driven mammary cancer.
--------
RANKL/RANK control Brca1 mutation-driven mammary tumors
--------
We therefore speculated that RANKL/RANK might have a role in the etiology of BRCA1/2 mutation-driven breast cancer.
--------
Here, using two different mouse models, we show that genetic inactivation of the key osteoclast differentiation factor RANK in the mammary epithelium markedly delayed onset, reduced incidence, and attenuated progression of Brca1;p53 mutation-driven mammary cancer.
--------
Since genetic deletion or pharmacological inhibition of RANK delays the onset and even prevents Brca1 and Brca1;p53 mutation-driven mammary tumors, we speculated that RANKL/RANK might affect proliferation and expansion of mammary progenitor cells.
--------
RANK and Brca1 mutation-driven breast cancer
--------
Therefore, to directly assess the role of RANKL/RANK in Brca1 mutation-mediated tumorigenesis in vivo, we first deleted Brca1 and p53 in basal mammary epithelial cells and mammary progenitor cells using K5Cre mice16 to induce mammary cancer as previously reported17,18.
--------
All intermediate-grade tumors that developed in double- and triple-mutant mice expressed the basal epithelial marker CK5; however, in high-grade tumors from WapCreC;Brca1;p53 double-mutant females we observed marked downregulation of CK5 expression (Figure 2B, Supplementary information, Figure S7A and S7B), supporting the notion of manifest epithelial dedifferentiation of these high-grade mammary cancers.
--------
In mice the incidence of mammary tumors in the presence of only Brca1 mutation is low.
--------
Since genetic deletion or pharmacological inhibition of RANK delays the onset and even prevents Brca1 and Brca1;p53 mutation-driven mammary tumors, we speculated that RANKL/RANK might affect proliferation and expansion of mammary progenitor cells.
--------
Therefore, to directly assess the role of RANKL/RANK in Brca1 mutation-mediated tumorigenesis in vivo, we first deleted Brca1 and p53 in basal mammary epithelial cells and mammary progenitor cells using K5Cre mice16 to induce mammary cancer as previously reported17,18.
--------
The differences between individual Brca1 tumors prompted us to generate and characterize multiple cell lines from each original mammary tumor.
--------
Molecular analysis reveals heterogeneity of mouse mammary tumors conditionally mutant for Brca1
--------
In spite of previously established genomic instability associated with Brca1 deficiency [16,27,32-34], transplantation of original Brca1 mouse mammary tumors into naïve recipients and generation of cell lines from these tumors provides a reliable source of material with relatively stable expression profile.
--------
Thus, serial transplantation of Brca1 mammary tumors resulted in minimal gene expression profile changes.
--------
In spite of previously established genomic instability associated with Brca1 deficiency [16,27,32-34], transplantation of original Brca1 mouse mammary tumors into naïve recipients and generation of cell lines from these tumors provides a reliable source of material with relatively stable expression profile.
--------
Genetic instability associated with BRCA1 deficiency [28,33,34] is believed to be responsible for therapeutic failures, but the role of breast cancer stem cells in tumor progression and drug resistance in this disease are not known.
--------
Development of multiple mouse models with deletion or mutations in Brca1 targeted to the mammary gland has provided an opportunity to examine the biology and therapeutic implications of BRCA1 loss in breast cancer [15] and some studies find similarities between the mouse and human tumors [11,16,17].
--------
We examined the expression profiles of original and serially transplanted mammary tumors from Brca1 deficient mice, and tumor derived cell lines to validate their use for preclinical testing and studies of tumor biology.
--------
Thus, in contrast to other mouse mammary tumor models in which the genomic features allow pooling multiple original tumors for expansion in vivo to provide virtually unlimited starting material, Brca1 mammary tumors should be analyzed individually and not pooled.
--------
Expansion of Brca1 deficient mammary tumors by transplantation is a useful alternative for generating sufficient material for studying Brca1-associated tumorigenesis.
--------
Development of multiple mouse models with deletion or mutations in Brca1 targeted to the mammary gland has provided an opportunity to examine the biology and therapeutic implications of BRCA1 loss in breast cancer [15] and some studies find similarities between the mouse and human tumors [11,16,17].
--------
It would be important to determine whether other BRCA1-deficient human and mouse tumors with EMT features are enriched in putative breast cancer stem cells.
--------
These differences are likely to reflect the innate heterogeneity of Brca1 mouse mammary tumors and analysis of multiple individual tumors would be required for selection of appropriate tumors that correlate with human disease [28].
--------
Given the apparent heterogeneity of Brca1 mammary tumors, we examined the extent to which serial transplantations of individual tumors affect gene expression.
--------
Thus, in contrast to other mouse mammary tumor models in which the genomic features allow pooling multiple original tumors for expansion in vivo to provide virtually unlimited starting material, Brca1 mammary tumors should be analyzed individually and not pooled.
--------
Two models with Brca1 deficiency were featured in a large study that used multiple other mouse mammary tumor models [17], and included 7 mammary tumors that arose after irradiation of Brca1+/-, p53+/- mice (designated Brca1+/-, p53+/- IR-Koller) and 10 tumors from Brca1Co/Co, p53+/-, MMTV-Cre strain, equivalent to the tumors used in our study (designated Brca1-Furth).
--------

--------
In spite of having a similar size at the time of collection (approximately 1 gm of wet weight), heterogeneity of Brca1 mammary tumors was also evident upon pathological examination of morphology, immunohistochemistry, and immunofluorescence analysis of tumor markers.
--------
In spite of increased penetrance when mice heterozygous for the Tp53 tumor suppressor are crossed with mice harboring mutant Brca1, these mice develop mammary tumors in over one year, at which time development of lymphomas, which is characteristic of p53-deficient background, also compromises animal survival [20].
--------
In this study, we have used clinically relevant cell lines with known BRCA1 mutations and report the in-vivo association of BRCA1 and Ubc9 in normal mammary epithelial cells but not in BRCA1 mutant HGSOC and TNBC cells by immunofluorescence analysis.
--------
As shown in Figure 5 Ubc9 siRNA significantly inhibited the migration of ES-2 ovarian cancer cells (Figure 5A), HCC1937 BRCA1 mutant TNBC cells (Figure 5 C) and CAL-51 a non-BRCA1 mutant TNBC cells (Figure 5 D).
--------
Using these cells we have studied the in vivo association of BRCA1 with Ubc9, expression of Ubc9 in these BRCA1 mutant TNBC and HGSOC cell lines and tumor tissues.
--------
As shown in Figure 5 Ubc9 siRNA significantly inhibited the migration of ES-2 ovarian cancer cells (Figure 5A), HCC1937 BRCA1 mutant TNBC cells (Figure 5 C) and CAL-51 a non-BRCA1 mutant TNBC cells (Figure 5 D).
--------
Future work will focus on studying whether Ubc9 expression could show a positive correlation with BRCA1 linked HGSOC and basal like TNBC phenotype.
--------
Both BRCA1/BRCA1a K109R and disease associated C61G mutants, which are localized mainly in the cytoplasm, fail to suppress the growth of TNBC and ovarian cancer cells [34].
--------
Loss of association of BRCA1 and Ubc9 in BRCA1 mutant HGSOC and TNBC cells
--------
Furthermore, we have demonstrated that this results in elevated levels of expression of Ubc9 both at the RNA as well as protein levels in these BRCA1 Ubc9 mutant UWB1.289 ovarian cancer and HCC1937 TNBC cells.
--------
Future work will address whether TNBC and HGSOC with BRCA1 mutations can be selectively eliminated using drugs that target Ubc9.
--------
In this study, we have used clinically relevant cell lines with known BRCA1 mutations and report the in-vivo association of BRCA1 and Ubc9 in normal mammary epithelial cells but not in BRCA1 mutant HGSOC and TNBC cells by immunofluorescence analysis.
--------
In this study, we have used clinically relevant cell lines with known BRCA1 mutations and report the in-vivo association of BRCA1 and Ubc9 in normal mammary epithelial cells but not in BRCA1 mutant HGSOC and TNBC cells by immunofluorescence analysis.
--------
Knockdown of Ubc9 expression resulted in decreased proliferation and migration of BRCA1 mutant TNBC and HGSOC cells.
--------
BRCA1-mutant HGSOC/TNBC cells and ovarian tumor tissues showed increased expression of Ubc9 compared to BRCA1 reconstituted HGSOC, normal mammary epithelial cells and matched normal ovarian tissues.
--------
Here we have used two physiological relevant patient derived cell lines obtained from BRCA1 mutant TNBC and HGSOC and have shown loss of association of BRCA1 proteins with Ubc9 in these cells unlike normal mammary epithelial cells.
--------
As mentioned earlier, we observed overexpression of Ubc9 in BRCA1 mutant TNBC cells and HGSOC cells.
--------
As shown in Figure 5 Ubc9 siRNA significantly inhibited the migration of ES-2 ovarian cancer cells (Figure 5A), HCC1937 BRCA1 mutant TNBC cells (Figure 5 C) and CAL-51 a non-BRCA1 mutant TNBC cells (Figure 5 D).
--------
Using these cells we have studied the in vivo association of BRCA1 with Ubc9, expression of Ubc9 in these BRCA1 mutant TNBC and HGSOC cell lines and tumor tissues.
--------
This is the first study demonstrating the functional link between BRCA1 mutation, high Ubc9 expression and increased migration of HGSOC and TNBC cells.
--------
Loss of association of BRCA1 and Ubc9 in BRCA1 mutant HGSOC and TNBC cells
--------
We have also found that knockdown of endogenous Ubc9 using siRNA resulted in suppression of cell proliferation and migration of Brca1 mutant TNBC and ovarian cancer cells.
--------
To examine whether this occurs in vivo, we have studied the association of BRCA1 and Ubc9 in normal mouse mammary epithelial cells MCF10A and a basal-like TNBC cell line HCC1937 obtained from a patient with germ line BRCA1 mutation using immunofluorescence analysis.
--------
Thus, in light of our finding that activation of Notch1 can enhance expression of EMT signature genes, including Fibronectin and Slug, we believe that Notch1 may drive TNBC formation under BRCA1-defective conditions by inducing expression of EMT signature genes, thereby promoting the transdifferentiation of luminal cells into the basal-type and at the same time strongly enhancing TNBC progression.
--------
Using the Sleeping Beauty transposon system in Brca1-deficient mice, we identified 169 putative cancer drivers, among which Notch1 is a top candidate for accelerating TNBC by promoting the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and regulating the cell cycle.
--------
Moreover, under BRCA1-defective conditions, NOTCH1 tended to display an enhanced ability to promote TNBC and basal-type breast cancer (Supplementary Fig. 8c, d).
--------
Further analysis revealed several previously unknown functions of Notch1 that may be necessary in accelerating Brca1-related TNBC tumourigenesis.
--------
In 54 BRCA1-deficient breast cancers in this cohort, increased expression of NOTCH1 also correlated with TNBC and the basal-type.
--------
Analysis of the human breast cancer database revealed a close correlation between high expression levels of NOTCH1 and TNBC incidence, especially BRCA1-related TNBC.
--------
In conclusion, our results indicate that NOTCH1 may be an oncogenic driver for BRCA1-related TNBC and basal-type tumours.
--------
Here, the authors use the Sleeping Beauty mutagenesis system in Brca1 deficient mice and identify 169 putative driver genes, of which NOTCH1 accelerates TNBC formation through promoting epithelial-mesenchymal transition and cell cycle progression.
--------
Given our finding that NOTCH1 promotes BRCA1-deficient tumour growth by activating ATR–CHK1 and inducing EMT, we inhibited the ATR/CHK1 pathway in combination with a low dose of cisplatin to effectively kill TNBC in our mouse model and PDX model55.
--------
Further analysis identifies Notch1 as a top putative oncogene that overcomes apoptosis caused by Brca1 deficiency and promotes TNBC formation by activating the epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) signalling pathway.
--------
NOTCH1 activation compensates BRCA1 deficiency and promotes triple-negative breast cancer formation
--------
Analysis of protein levels in BRCA1-deficient tumours indicated that a high protein expression level of NOTCH1 correlated with TNBC incidence (Supplementary Fig. 8a, b).
--------
BRCA1 is essential for taxane-mediated apoptosis [7]; some, although not all, clinical studies suggest decreased efficacy of taxane-containing schemes in BRCA1-driven BCs [8].
--------
BRCA1 is essential for taxane-mediated apoptosis [7]; some, although not all, clinical studies suggest decreased efficacy of taxane-containing schemes in BRCA1-driven BCs [8].
--------
In this work, we have used both germline and somatic engineering approaches to rapidly test candidate cancer drivers in the WB1P mouse model of BRCA1-deficient TNBC.
--------
To address these questions, we generate additional mouse models of BRCA1-deficient TNBC harboring different candidate genes.
--------
To overcome the time-consuming nature of generating these mouse models via germline engineering, we develop somatic mouse models of BRCA1-deficient TNBC and we show that these models accurately reflect their germline counterparts.
--------
Here, we have shown that somatic engineering using lentiviral vectors for overexpression of cDNAs and CRISPR-mediated in situ gene editing provides an effective alternative for rapid generation of novel mouse models of BRCA1-deficient TNBC.
--------
In summary, we applied novel germline and somatic technologies to functionally validate the role of candidate drivers in BRCA1-deficient TNBC in vivo at unprecedented speed.
--------
Unlike high expression of cyclin E1, which is predictive of poor survival, 19q12 (CCNE1) amplification had no prognostic value for overall survival in BRCA1 mutated breast cancer (Fig. 1h).
--------
Consequently, we examined the relationship between BRCA1 methylation and cyclin E1 protein expression by interrogating the breast cancer dataset of the TCGA.
--------
The cyclin E1 degradation machinery is disrupted in BRCA1 mutated breast cancers
--------
In this study, we examined whether BRCA1 loss and cyclin E1 gain occurred concurrently or independently in breast cancer.
--------
Next, we examined the association between cyclin E1 expression and overall survival in germline BRCA1 mutated breast cancers in our cohort.
--------
Overall, these data implicate increased cyclin E1 protein stability, rather than gene amplification, as the cause for high cyclin E1 levels observed in BRCA1 mutated breast cancer.
--------
In summary, BRCA1 mutated breast cancers were characterized by reduced cyclin E1 T62 phosphorylation and elevated USP28 expression.
--------
BRCA1 inactivation associates with high cyclin E1 expression in breast cancer
--------
BRCA1 mutation directly drives the basal phenotype, and mice with Tp53 and Brca1 deletion develop mammary tumors with basal-like characteristics7 while intact Brca1 represses the transcription of basal cytokeratins8.
--------
Since 19q12 (CCNE1) amplification is associated with poor survival in other cancer types we examined its relationship with overall survival in BRCA1 mutated breast cancer.
--------
BRCA1 mutation directly drives the basal phenotype, and mice with Tp53 and Brca1 deletion develop mammary tumors with basal-like characteristics7 while intact Brca1 represses the transcription of basal cytokeratins8.
--------
We also explored the mechanisms underpinning high cyclin E1 expression in BRCA1 mutated breast cancer including gene amplification and protein stability.
--------
Brca1L63X/+ rat is a novel model of human BRCA1 deficiency displaying susceptibility to radiation‐induced mammary cancer
--------
A random‐mutagenesis study has produced the first Brca1 knockout rat, but this strain did not show an increased incidence of mammary cancer.14
--------
Mammary cancer incidence before age 40 weeks is characteristic of rats irradiated after, but not before, puberty,19 implying a specific puberty‐related mechanism of tumor development before 40 weeks29; the present result suggests that this mechanism is independent of the Brca1 genotype.
--------
Comparison of untreated Brca1L63X/+ and Brca1+/+ rats illustrated no clear difference in mammary cancer incidence (Table 3, Figure 3A).
--------
The present study is the first report that a single heterozygous germline mutation of Brca1 can impose breast cancer susceptibility in a laboratory rodent when exposed to ionizing radiation, thus suggesting the use of the Brca1L63X/+ rat as a new model recapitulating the features of the human disease.
--------
The Brca1L63X/+ rats thus offer the first single‐mutation, heterozygous model of BRCA1‐associated breast cancer, especially with exposure to a DNA break‐inducing carcinogen.
--------
Second, many mouse strains with mammary‐specific homozygous Brca1 deficiency, as in humans, develop ERα‐low mammary cancer,10 which is recapitulated by the present heterozygous rat model.
--------
Here the authors used the rat, a less common but good model of breast cancer, to produce a Brca1 knockout that affects one copy and mimics a human variant common in Japan.
--------
Previous Brca1‐heterozygous animal models do not recapitulate the breast cancer phenotype, and thus all currently used knockout models adopt conditional, mammary‐specific homozygous Brca1 loss or addition of Trp53 deficiency.
--------
These results suggest that the early‐onset mammary cancer before 40 weeks is intrinsic to Jcl:SD rats irradiated at 7 weeks and independent of the Brca1 genotype, whereas mammary carcinogenesis during middle age was prominent in irradiated Brca1L63X/+ rats.
--------
The age at autopsy was significantly younger, and the number of rats with carcinoma and the number of carcinomas developing per unit time were slightly higher, in Brca1L63X/+ than Brca1+/+ rats treated with 25 mg/kg MNU (Table 3); however, the slight increase in the mammary cancer incidence did not reach statistical significance (Figure 3B).
--------
The HR of early‐onset mammary cancer (i.e., <40 weeks of age) showed a tendency toward dose dependence independently of the Brca1 genotype (Figure 4D), whereas HR during middle age (40–80 weeks) was significantly dose dependent only in Brca1L63X/+ rats (p = 0.045; in Brca1+/+, p = 0.82; Figure 4E); no clear dose response was observed later (Figure 4F).
--------
In Brca1L63X/+ and Brca1+/+ rats irradiated at this age, as expected, the early‐onset component of carcinogenesis was diminished, and a clear and significant difference in mammary cancer incidence was indicated between the two genotypes (Figure 4G).
--------
Mammary tumor incidence in Brca1L63X/+ rats and their littermate Brca1+/+ rats
--------
Histology of mammary cancer showed no clear difference between Brca1L63X/+ and Brca1+/+ rats (Figure 5A,B).
--------
Taken together, our findings characterize the Brca1L63X/+ rat mammary cancer model, the first single‐gene, heterozygous model mimicking aspects of BRCA1 deficiency in humans.
--------
Third, Brca1L63X/+ rats did not display increased incidence of mammary cancer in the absence of carcinogenic exposure, a feature common to all previously reported Brca1 heterozygous mouse/rat models.10, 14
--------
In our study, patients with BRCA1 gene mutations were tested for the expression of steroid receptors (ERβ, ERα and PgR) and the HER-2 receptor in breast cancer tissue.
--------
In conclusion, we have validated preclinically a new therapeutic approach for BRCA1 deficient breast cancer through reactivation of mutant p53.
--------
Because the Brca1-deficient mammary tumor latency spans 4–12 months with mice developing multiple tumors with different growth kinetics, we initially sought to study this combination using a simpler tumor model in which the mice acquired tumors at relatively the same time, and the duration of therapy was relatively short.
--------
To evaluate the effects of p53 mutant reactivation in the setting of Brca1 loss, we examined the effect of ZMC1 in mouse models of Brca1-deficient mammary cancer that harbor either the zinc-binding deficient p53R172H (mouse equivalent of human p53R175H) or a p53-null mutation.
--------
Here for the first time we have demonstrated pre-clinically that reactivating mutant p53 in the setting of Brca1 deficient breast cancer is highly therapeutic.
--------
The near universal dependence on p53 inactivation in BRCA1 mutant tumor progression suggests that this relationship might be therapeutically exploited.2,11 Examples of approaches to target TP53 mutations include inhibition of complementary cell cycle checkpoints mediated by WEE1 and Chk1, but these strategies only indirectly target p53 defect.12,13 A more attractive approach would be to directly restore wild type p53 function in a BRCA1 deficient breast cancer.
--------
Virtually all BRCA1 deficient breast cancers harbor mutations in TP53 suggesting that inactivation of p53 is a requirement for tumor progression in the setting of BRCA1 deficiency.
--------
To evaluate the effects of p53 mutant reactivation in the setting of Brca1 loss, we examined the effect of ZMC1 in mouse models of Brca1-deficient mammary cancer that harbor either the zinc-binding deficient p53R172H (mouse equivalent of human p53R175H) or a p53-null mutation.
--------
Here we explored the therapeutic relationship between TP53 and BRCA1 mutations in breast cancer using ZMCs as a tool to restore wild type p53 function.
--------
Therapeutic targeting of BRCA1 and TP53 mutant breast cancer through mutant p53 reactivation
--------
The near universal dependence on p53 inactivation in BRCA1 mutant tumor progression suggests that this relationship might be therapeutically exploited.2,11 Examples of approaches to target TP53 mutations include inhibition of complementary cell cycle checkpoints mediated by WEE1 and Chk1, but these strategies only indirectly target p53 defect.12,13 A more attractive approach would be to directly restore wild type p53 function in a BRCA1 deficient breast cancer.
--------
ZMC1 reactivates mutant p53 in mouse models of Brca1-deficient breast cancer
--------
Due to this dependency, we hypothesized that restoring wild type p53 function in BRCA1 deficient breast cancer would be therapeutic.
--------
Using murine breast cancer models with Brca1 deficiency, we demonstrate that ZMC1 significantly improves survival of mice bearing tumors harboring the zinc-deficient Trp53R172H allele but not the Trp53−/− allele.
--------
This provides evidence supporting the concept that the dependency on loss of TP53 in BRCA1 mutant human breast cancers can be exploited therapeutically.
--------
ZMC1 and a new formulation (ZMC1-zinc complex) improve survival in the Brca1-deficient mammary tumor GEMM in a Trp53R172H allele specific fashion
--------
The basal-like breast cancer cell line, HCC1937, harbours a nonsense mutation in the BRCA1 gene leading to a premature stop codon prior to the DNA binding domain.
--------
Depletion of BRCA1 protein in mouse mammary glands results in defects in lactational development and increased susceptibility to mammary cancer.
--------
We found that loss of p16 transforms Brca1-deficient mammary epithelial cells and induces mammary tumors, though p16 loss alone is not sufficient to induce spontaneous mammary tumorigenesis.
--------
We noticed that both the tumor cell morphology and expression pattern of CK5 and CK14 in p16;Brca1 double mutant mouse mammary tumors resembled human basal-like breast cancers that were ER-negative and expressed low BRCA1 (Supplementary Figure S4).
--------
Consistently, heterozygous germline deletion of Brca1 or specific deletion of Brca1 in mouse mammary epithelial cells rarely develop mammary tumors.
--------
RB is a major target for genomic disruption in BRCA1 mutant human breast cancers and loss of both RB and BRCA1 is a feature of basal-like breast cancers [34, 36, 49].
--------
We found that p16 loss transformed Brca1-deficient mammary epithelial cells and induced mammary tumors, though p16 loss alone was not sufficient to induce mammary tumorigenesis.
--------
More importantly, all p16;Brca1 compound mutant mammary tumors are poorly differentiated basal-like tumors with enriched TICs and activated EMT features.
--------
Loss of p53 or its downstream target, p21, in vivo as well as knockdown of p16 or its downstream target, Rb, in vitro partially rescues the premature senescence of Brca1-deficient cells [24–28, 30], suggesting that disruption of the p53 and p16-Rb pathway are required to overcome Brca1-deficiency induced senescence and induce breast cancers.
--------
These data indicate that depletion of both p16 and Brca1 results in basal-like mammary tumors with activation of EMT, which is consistent with our previous finding that deletion of Brca1 activates EMT in mammary tumorigenesis [25].
--------
Previous findings [12–14] that mice lacking p16 or targeting DNA methylation within the p16 promoter rarely develop mammary tumors suggests that p16 loss alone is not sufficient for mammary tumorigenesis in vivo. Interestingly, loss of p16 increases MEC proliferation, rescues Brca1-deficiency induced MEC senescence, and induces mammary tumors in a Brca1-deficient background, suggesting that p16 collaborates with Brca1 to suppress mammary tumorigenesis.
--------
These data suggest that p16;Brca1 double-mutant mammary tumors are enriched with mammary tumor initiating cells.
--------
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first genetic evidence directly showing that p16 which is frequently deleted and inactivated in human breast cancers, collaborates with Brca1 controlling mammary tumorigenesis.
--------
We demonstrated that loss of p16 and Brca1 collaboratively induce basal-like mammary tumor development with the induction of EMT.
--------
We noticed that both the tumor cell morphology and expression pattern of CK5 and CK14 in p16;Brca1 double mutant mouse mammary tumors resembled human basal-like breast cancers that were ER-negative and expressed low BRCA1 (Supplementary Figure S4).
--------
Depletion of both p16 and Brca1 leads to basal-like mammary tumors with EMT features
--------
These results indicate that haploid or complete loss of p16 transforms Brca1-deficient mammary epithelial cells and induces mammary tumors.
--------
About 10% of Brca1+/− or Brca1f/f;MMTV-cre mice develop mammary tumors by 18 months of age [24, 25, 27–29].
--------
Loss of p53 or its downstream target, p21, in vivo as well as knockdown of p16 or its downstream target, Rb, in vitro partially rescues the premature senescence of Brca1-deficient cells [24–28, 30], suggesting that disruption of the p53 and p16-Rb pathway are required to overcome Brca1-deficiency induced senescence and induce breast cancers.
--------
We demonstrated that loss of both p16 and Brca1 led to metastatic, basal-like, mammary tumors with the induction of EMT and an enrichment of tumor initiating cells.

Consistently, heterozygous germline deletion of Brca1 or specific deletion of Brca1 in mouse mammary epithelial cells rarely develop mammary tumors.

--------
NMU-induced primary and invasive rat breast cancers expressed high levels of rat BRCA1-IRIS mRNA but low levels of rat ERα mRNA.
--------
Induction of primary and invasive rat mammary tumors using the carcinogen N-methyl-N-nitrosourea (NMU), followed by analysis of rat BRCA1-IRIS and ERα mRNA levels in these tumors.
--------
These data show a gradual and continuous increase in rat BRCA1-IRIS mRNA expression during breast cancer progression/invasion, which correlates with significant decrease in the expression of rat ERα mRNA and strongly support the notion that BRCA1-IRIS overexpression is involved in breast cancer progression, most likely of the HER2+ and/or TN/BL subtypes.
--------
We found that carcinogen-induced rat breast cancers overexpress rat BRCA1-IRIS mRNA in some aggressive primary tumors or upon disease progression.
--------
These data show a gradual and continuous increase in rat BRCA1-IRIS mRNA expression during breast cancer progression/invasion, which correlates with significant decrease in the expression of rat ERα mRNA and strongly support the notion that BRCA1-IRIS overexpression is involved in breast cancer progression, most likely of the HER2+ and/or TN/BL subtypes.

--------
To directly assess the involvement of BRCA1-IRIS in breast cancer progression, primary tumors from NMU-treated rats, as well as their invasive transplants, were analyzed for the expression of rat BRCA1-IRIS mRNA using RT/PCR (a rat BRCA1-IRIS specific antibody is currently unavailable).
--------
Previous reports have shown that taxol [49] and docetaxel [50] similarly increase cyclin B1 levels in BRCA1 wild type MDA-MB-231 cells and MDA-MB-468 cells suggesting that cyclin B1 loss may not be unique to PTX resistant TNBC cells.
--------
These findings suggest that S100a9 could act as a signal from Brca1-MT mammary epithelial cells and WT breast cancer cells to immune cells.
--------
A study on mouse has also revealed that Brca1-deficient mammary tumors with p53 mutations seem to have higher TIL levels than tumors without p53 mutation21.
--------
S100A9-CXCL12 activation in BRCA1-mutant breast cancer promotes an immunosuppressive microenvironment associated with resistance to immunotherapy
--------
To support the upregulated S100a9 signal caused by the loss of Brca1 could increase S100a9 protein levels, we knocked down BRCA1 in WT mouse mammary epithelial cells B477, and human breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cells and found that S100A9 protein levels were increased in both cell types via immunofluorescence (IF) staining (Fig. 3f) and Western blot analysis (Fig. 3g).
--------
Although the exact mechanism for the increased levels of PD-1 and PD-L1 in BRCA1-deficient breast cancers remains elusive, we believe pSTAT3 might play an important role in this as a previous study has indicated that STAT3 activation could be responsible for the increased expression of PD-L146.
--------
Because disruption of Brca1 in whole body of mouse resulted in embryonic lethality17, we have previously generated a conditional mutant mouse model carrying with MMTV-Cre-mediated deletion of the full-length isoform of Brca1 (Brca1Co/Co;MMTV-Cre) in the mammary tissue, and found the mutant mice developed mammary tumors after a long latency, which is accelerated in a p53 heterozygous background (Brca1Co/Co;p53+/-;MMTV-Cre)8.
--------
To evaluate the significance of our findings for prediction of the treatment efficacy in human breast cancer patients, we analyzed a human patient database and found the correlations between the finding of our study and the human patient datasets regarding the BRCA1 deficiency-associated action of S100A9-CXCL12 axis.
--------
To support the upregulated S100a9 signal caused by the loss of Brca1 could increase S100a9 protein levels, we knocked down BRCA1 in WT mouse mammary epithelial cells B477, and human breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cells and found that S100A9 protein levels were increased in both cell types via immunofluorescence (IF) staining (Fig. 3f) and Western blot analysis (Fig. 3g).
--------
Thus, we tested the efficacy of combination treatment with a chemical inhibitor of S100A9 or CXCL12 and αPD1 in BRCA1-MT mice, and found the treatment significantly inhibited mammary tumor growth, recurrence, and metastasis.
--------
Because disruption of Brca1 in whole body of mouse resulted in embryonic lethality17, we have previously generated a conditional mutant mouse model carrying with MMTV-Cre-mediated deletion of the full-length isoform of Brca1 (Brca1Co/Co;MMTV-Cre) in the mammary tissue, and found the mutant mice developed mammary tumors after a long latency, which is accelerated in a p53 heterozygous background (Brca1Co/Co;p53+/-;MMTV-Cre)8.
--------
In the analysis of human database, we found that S100A9 expression level was positively correlated with human breast cancer development stages (Supplementary Fig. 2e) and Pearson correlation analysis revealed a negative correlation between BRCA1 and S100A9 in breast cancer patients (Supplementary Fig. 2f).
--------
While Wu et al. found an inverse correlation between Wnt signaling and BRCA1 expression in basal-like breast cancer due to epigenetic repression of BRCA1 by the Wnt effector Slug [50], Li et al. reported that the nuclear form of β-catenin was lower or absent in most BRCA1 familial breast cancer tissues compared to sporadic breast cancer or healthy tissue [51].
--------
Thus, we hypothesize a negative regulatory role of PAF-AH on the Wnt/β-catenin pathway, especially in BRCA1 mutant BC.

--------
Significantly higher nuclear PAF-AH expression was detected in BRCA1 mutated BC specimens compared to BRCA-WT (Figure 1).
--------
By performing immunohistochemistry, PAF-AH expression and β-catenin expression were examined in both BRCA1 WT and BRCA1 mutant breast cancer specimens.
--------
Functional in vitro experiments showed a protective role of PAF-AH in BRCA1 mutated BC and suggested a negative regulatory impact of PAF-AH on the canonical Wnt signaling pathway.

--------
In this study, we analyze the functional impact of PAF-AH on BRCA1 mutant breast cancer and explore its relationship to the Wnt signaling pathway.
--------
A changed distribution pattern of β-catenin within the cellular departments in BRCA1 mutant BC cells caused by PLA2G7 gene knockdown confirms a regulatory influence of PLA2G7/PAF-AH on the Wnt signaling pathway.
--------
2.1. Nuclear PAF-AH Is Highly Expressed in BRCA1 Mutant BC Tissue and Correlates Positively with Membranous β-Catenin
--------
Both PLA2G7 expression on the mRNA level (p < 0.01; Figure 2A) and PAF-AH expression on the protein level (p < 0.001; Figure 2B) were significantly increased in the BRCA1 mutant BC cell line HCC1937 compared to MCF10A and other BC cell lines.
--------
In this study, we aim to characterize PAF-AH expression in BRCA1 mutated BC as well as its regulatory effects on the Wnt signaling pathway.
--------
By performing immunohistochemistry, PAF-AH expression and β-catenin expression were examined in both BRCA1 WT and BRCA1 mutant breast cancer specimens.
--------
The BRCA1 mutant breast cancer cell line HCC1937 was used for in vitro experiments to assess the impact of PAF-AH on cellular functions.
--------
Both PLA2G7 expression on the mRNA level (p < 0.01; Figure 2A) and PAF-AH expression on the protein level (p < 0.001; Figure 2B) were significantly increased in the BRCA1 mutant BC cell line HCC1937 compared to MCF10A and other BC cell lines.
--------
Based on our experimental results involving BC cell lines and patient specimens, we found an increased PAF-AH expression in BRCA1 mutant BC cells and identify PAF-AH as a potential negative regulator of the canonical Wnt/β-catenin pathway.
--------
PLA2G7/PAF-AH as Potential Negative Regulator of the Wnt Signaling Pathway Mediates Protective Effects in BRCA1 Mutant Breast Cancer
--------
Consistently, relevant gene and protein expression of PLA2G7/PAF-AH were only shown in BRCA1 mutant cell line HCC1937 (Figure 2A,B), while other BC cell lines show almost no PAF-AH expression compared to benign breast cells.
--------
Although the genomics features of mouse Brca1 mammary tumors have recently been analyzed by WES30,43, such analyses have not been reported for mouse Brca2 and Palb2 tumors.
--------
Genetic interactions among Brca1, Brca2, Palb2, and Trp53 in mammary tumor development
--------
We observed a functional equivalence of the three genes in their basic tumor-suppressive activity, a linear epistasis of Palb2 and Brca2, but complementary roles of Brca1 and Palb2 in mammary tumor suppression, as combined ablation of either Palb2 or Brca2 with Brca1 led to delayed tumor formation.
--------
Collectively, our results suggest that elevated ROS rather than DNA damage may be responsible for the increased apoptosis of the Brca1;Palb2 double KO MECs and therefore may contribute to the reduced mammary tumor formation in these mice.
--------
It should be noted, however, while human BRCA1 breast cancers indeed show higher LST scores than BRCA2 and PALB2 cancers49, MET amplification is a rare event in human BRCA1/2 and PALB2 breast cancers based on our analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas database and our own sequencing datasets (not shown).
--------
Our results indicated a functional equivalence of the three genes in their basic tumor-suppressive activity, a linear epistasis of Palb2 and Brca2, but complementary roles of Brca1 and Palb2 in mammary tumor suppression.
--------
Indeed, various degrees of recombination of the foxed Trp53, Brca1, and Palb2 alleles were detected by PCR genotyping in available non-mammary tumors (Supplementary Fig. 2), indicating that the Wap-cre was indeed leaky and that at least some of those tumors might stem from the unintended gene ablation events.
--------
For example, one of the liver tumors arising from P2p53 mice showed complete Palb2 deletion and likely stemmed from PALB2 loss; a lung tumor and a liver tumor from B1p53 mice showed strong Brca1 deletion to a degree similar to that found in mammary tumors from mice in the same cohort (Supplementary Fig. 2), suggesting that these two tumors might have arisen due to BRCA1 loss.
--------
The nearly identical timing of the “first wave” of mammary tumor development suggests that BRCA1, BRCA2, and PALB2 may be functionally equivalent in mammary tumor suppression.

--------
To understand the mechanism underlying the delayed mammary tumor development in B1P2p mice, we asked whether combined loss of BRCA1 and PALB2 would cause synthetic lethality in MECs, thereby reducing their overall tumorigenic potential.
--------
To compare directly the latency, penetrance, and various features of BRCA1, BRCA2, and PALB2-associated mammary tumor development, we set out to ablate the three genes in parallel in mice using Wap-cre, which is predominantly expressed in the secretory epithelium in the mammary gland27.

BRCA1 also regulates p53-dependent gene expression,75 and cooccurrence of somatic TP53 PVs is more commonly observed with BRCA1 PVs, compared with BRCA2 PVs.76 Furthermore, mammary-specific deletion of Tp53 and Brca1 leads to the development of murine mammary tumors having genomic and transcriptomic similarities to human basal-like BC.77 These potential biologic mechanisms linking BRCA1 to lobule expansion during pregnancy may offer insights into why the peak risk window for poor prognosis in PPBC among BRCA1 PV carriers was observed later.

--------
These data suggest that while the loss of P53 occurs in a large proportion of BRCA1-deficient breast cancer, additional tumor driver mutations are still necessary for tumorigenesis in a significant portion of the tumors in both mice and humans.
--------
These results demonstrated that knockout of Plekha5/PLEKHA5 could promote cell metastasis to distant organs such as the liver or lung, in both BRCA1-deficient and BRCA1-WT breast cancer in both humans and mice.
--------
In a mouse model carrying a mammary-specific deletion of the full-length Brca1, we found that mammary tumors developed after a long period of latency and that the loss of p53 markedly accelerates tumorigenesis14.
--------
These results demonstrated that knockout of Plekha5/PLEKHA5 could promote cell metastasis to distant organs such as the liver or lung, in both BRCA1-deficient and BRCA1-WT breast cancer in both humans and mice.
--------
We have previously established a mouse model carrying mammary-specific disruption of the full length of Brca1 (Brca1co/co;MMTV-Cre or Brca1co/co;Wap-Cre) (Brca1MKO), which develops mammary tumors through multiple progressive steps involving spontaneous mutations of p53 and/or some other unidentified genes5,14.
--------
To determine whether there were similar CNV events in both human and mouse breast cancers, we then used the same approach to study CNVs from two human BRCA1-deficient (TM00089 and TM00091) xenograft breast tumors by single-cell and bulk WES.
--------
To understand the genetic features and evolution of BRCA1-deficient breast cancers and identify their drivers, we perform both bulk tissue WES and single-cell WES (scWES) for BRCA1-deficient mammary glands and tumors, followed by validation with Sanger sequencing or droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) assays, as well as functional validation with clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) and CRISPR-associated protein 9 (Cas9)-mediated knockouts in vitro and in vivo.
--------
In addition, we performed Plekha5 knockout in a GFP-labeled mouse Brca1-deficient mammary tumor cell line with low metastatic potential (G600-GFP) and implanted these cells into mice (Supplementary Fig. 6e).
--------
However, in allografts of mouse, BRCA1-/- mammary tumors, there was no tumor regression or remission although a partial inhibition of tumor growth was observed in both the BRCA1-/- and BRCA1+/+ allografts.
--------
The in vitro experiments were followed by in vivo examination of BRCA1+/+ and BRCA1-/- mammary tumors exposed to 5 days of high dose AG14361 treatment.
--------
The in vitro experiments were followed by in vivo examination of BRCA1+/+ and BRCA1-/- mammary tumors exposed to 5 days of high dose AG14361 treatment.
--------
Yet, these data were obtained by using non-cancerous and genetically naïve BRCA1/2-/- ES cells, BRCA2 conditional mutant mouse intestine, BRCA2-/- V-C8 hamster cells, and two BRCA2-proficient breast cancer cell lines, MCF7 and MAD-MB-231 that carried acute suppression of BRCA2 by siRNA.
--------
These results lend support to the possibility that BRCA1 hypermethylation may drive an ERα-negative phenotype through loss of the BRCA1-dependent transactivation of ESR1, suggesting that compounds (i.e., GEN) that reduce BRCA1 CpG methylation may hold promise as both preventive and adjuvant therapeutics for TNBC.
--------
Activation of the AHR leads to CpG methylation of the BRCA1 promoter [40,41], and the overexpression of AHR mRNA is observed in parallel with BRCA1 hypermethylation in TNBC patients [46].
--------
To determine if GEN exerted similar CpG demethylating effects on BRCA1 in TNBC, we treated HCC38 cells with GEN (10 μM) and various AHR antagonists in the presence of E2 (10 nM).
--------
The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of GEN on BRCA1 epigenetic regulation and AHR activity in vivo and TNBC cells.
--------
3.4. Rescue of BRCA1 Expression Is Linked to CpG Demethylation and AHR Inhibition in TNBC Cells
--------
Activation of the AHR leads to CpG methylation of the BRCA1 promoter [40,41], and the overexpression of AHR mRNA is observed in parallel with BRCA1 hypermethylation in TNBC patients [46].
--------
We conclude that the dietary compound GEN may be effective for the prevention and reversal of AHR-dependent BRCA1 hypermethylation, and the restoration of ERα-mediated response, thus imparting the sensitivity of TNBC to antiestrogen therapy.
--------
These results lend support to the possibility that BRCA1 hypermethylation may drive an ERα-negative phenotype through loss of the BRCA1-dependent transactivation of ESR1, suggesting that compounds (i.e., GEN) that reduce BRCA1 CpG methylation may hold promise as both preventive and adjuvant therapeutics for TNBC.

Moreover, the GEN-dependent upregulation of BRCA1 increases the expression of ERα, which may sensitize TNBC cells to antiestrogen therapeutics.

To identify genomic regions that are associated with BRCA1- and BRCA2-mutated breast cancers we compared aCGH data from 130 mouse Brca1Δ/Δ;p53Δ/Δ, Brca2Δ/Δ;p53Δ/Δ and p53Δ/Δ mammary tumor groups with 103 human BRCA1-mutated, BRCA2-mutated and non-hereditary breast cancers.
--------
To gain insight into the specific effects of BRCA1 or BRCA2 loss on genomic instability, we used aCGH profiles of genetically defined mouse models for BRCA1- and BRCA2-associated breast cancer as biological data filters to mine the human breast cancer genome [10,11].

--------
In this work, we analyzed and compared aCGH data from a large series of mouse and human BRCA1- and BRCA2-mutated breast cancers, in order to obtain a complete collection of genes and loci that are recurrently gained or lost in tumors of both species.
--------
To investigate the impact of BRCA1 and BRCA2 deficiency on chromosomal instability in breast epithelial cells, we performed aCGH on mammary tumors derived from our genetically engineered mouse (GEM) models for BRCA1- and BRCA2-associated breast cancer [10,11].
--------
Also, gains known to be important in human BRCA1-mutated breast cancer show no (e.g. 3q gain) or only partial (e.g. the 5q loss) overlap with the mouse gains and losses.
--------
In our analysis, we compared aCGH profiles from human BRCA1/2-mutated and sporadic breast cancers with profiles from mouse p53Δ/Δ, Brca1Δ/Δ;p53Δ/Δ and Brca2Δ/Δ;p53Δ/Δ mammary tumors.

--------
Mammary tumors induced with DMBA had reduced BRCA-1 and ERα expression; higher Brca-1 promoter CpG methylation; increased expression of Ahr and its downstream target Cyp1b1; and higher proliferation markers Ccnd1 (cyclin D1) and Cdk4. In human UACC-3199 cells, low BRCA-1 was paralleled by constitutive high AhR expression; the treatment with αNF rescued BRCA-1 and ERα, while enhancing preferential expression of CYP1A1 compared to CYP1B1. Conversely, in MCF-7 cells, αNF antagonized estradiol-dependent activation of BRCA-1 without effects on expression of ERα.
--------
The upregulation of Ahr and Cyp1b1 were paralleled by increased Brca-1 CpG methylation, and reduced expression of BRCA-1 and ERα in mammary tumors induced with DMBA.
--------
To our knowledge, this is the first study linking constitutive overexpression of the AhR to BRCA-1 promoter hypermethylation in DMBA-induced mammary tumors and human TNBC.
--------
Previously, we reported that AhR agonists repressed estradiol (E2)-dependent BRCA-1 transcription in human breast cancer cells [37–41].
--------
The rescue of BRCA-1 and ERα by αNF in UACC-3199 breast cancer cells were biological changes associated with preferential induction of CYP1A1. Conversely, αNF did not affect ERα levels, but antagonized E2-dependent activation of BRCA expression, in ERα-positive MCF-7 cells.
--------
Overall, these cell culture studies implied that the effects of αNF, selected as a prototype AhR antagonist, were influenced by cell-context and ERα status, i.e. αNF rescued BRCA-1 and ERα expression in sporadic and ERα-negative UACC-3199 breast cancer cells carrying hypermethylated BRCA-1.
--------
The upregulation of Ahr and Cyp1b1 were paralleled by increased Brca-1 CpG methylation, and reduced expression of BRCA-1 and ERα in mammary tumors induced with DMBA.
--------
To further elucidate the cross-talk between expression and/or activation of AhR, and BRCA-1 regulation, we turned to cell culture experiments using UACC-3199 sporadic breast cancer cells, which possess hypermethylated BRCA-1 promoter [21, 55] and express low ERα [56].
--------
Then, we compared the effects of αNF on BRCA-1 and ERα expression in MCF-7 and UACC-3199 breast cancer cells.
--------
The first objective of this study was to investigate the association between AhR expression and/or activation and Brca-1 promoter methylation status in mammary tumors.
--------
Therefore, we compared the expression of BRCA-1 and AhR in human ERα-positive MCF-7, and ERα-negative UACC-3199 sporadic, breast cancer cells.
--------
We evaluated Brca-1 CpG promoter methylation and expression in mammary tumors induced in Sprague–Dawley rats with the AhR agonist and mammary carcinogen 7,12-dimethyl-benzo(a)anthracene (DMBA).
--------
Conversely, αNF antagonized E2-dependent stimulation of BRCA-1 expression in ERα-positive MCF-7 breast cancer cells.
--------
Our prior cell culture [37–44] and rodent [47] model investigations of breast cancer provided evidence that the BRCA-1 gene was a molecular target for the AhR and various chromatin remodeling factors.
--------
In cell culture experiments, the treatment with α-naphthoflavone (αNF), a prototype SAhRM, exerted cell line-specific effects: in ERα-negative human UACC-3199 sporadic breast cancer cell line, it rescued BRCA-1 and ERα expression, while inducing CYP1A1; in ERα-positive MCF-7 breast cancer cells, αNF antagonized E2-dependent stimulation of BRCA-1 without affecting ERα expression.
--------
Therefore, understanding if changes in expression and/or activation of the AhR are associated with somatic inactivation of the BRCA-1 gene may provide clues for breast cancer therapy.
--------
In this study, we found that BARD1 and BRCA1 were highly expressed in tamoxifen-resistant breast cancer cells, which led to enhanced DNA damage repair and resistance to DNA-damaging chemotherapy.
--------
In contrast to the association between BRCA1/BARD1 mutation and increased risk of basal-like breast cancer, the analysis of multiple independent data sets showed that the expression of BARD1 and BRCA1 is associated with poor prognosis in ER-positive breast cancer patients, but not in ER-negative ones.
--------
Moreover, BARD1 and BRCA1 were positively correlated with p-AKT expression in primary and metastatic breast cancer samples (Fig. 6c, d), suggesting that BARD1/BRCA1 expression is associated with PI3K pathway activation.
--------
High BARD1/BRCA1 related to BC metastasis and poor prognosis
--------
Since high BARD1/BRCA1 expression predicts poor prognosis in ER+ early breast cancer patients, it is possible that PI3K inhibitors not only help to overcome endocrine resistance, but may also reverse the resistance to DNA-damaging chemotherapy and radiotherapy in ER+ early breast cancer patients that have a 29–45% chance of PIK3CA mutation.
--------
To further confirm the clinical relevance of the above findings, we analyzed the expression of BARD1 and BRCA1 in 27 paired primary and relapsed tumor samples from recurrent breast cancer patients who underwent adjuvant tamoxifen treatment and had their recurrent tumors biopsied or resected.
--------
In contrast to the association between BRCA1/BARD1 mutation and increased risk of basal-like breast cancer, the analysis of multiple independent data sets showed that the expression of BARD1 and BRCA1 is associated with poor prognosis in ER-positive breast cancer patients, but not in ER-negative ones.
--------
More importantly, high expression of BARD1 and BRCA1 was associated with poor prognosis of ER+ breast cancer patients, especially in those received radiation therapy.
--------
These results indicate that BARD1 and BRCA1 have previously unappreciated prognostic value in luminal-type breast cancer, which may be related with its high prevalence of PI3K pathway activation.
--------
Moreover, higher expression of BRCA1 was associated with significant shorter OS in ER-positive breast cancer patients from Curtis breast published on oncomine platform (Fig. 1c) and the meta-analysis of breast cancer patients from 27 data sets in GEO database (Supplementary Fig. 2b).
--------
Since high BARD1/BRCA1 expression predicts poor prognosis in ER+ early breast cancer patients, it is possible that PI3K inhibitors not only help to overcome endocrine resistance, but may also reverse the resistance to DNA-damaging chemotherapy and radiotherapy in ER+ early breast cancer patients that have a 29–45% chance of PIK3CA mutation.
--------
Higher BARD1 and BRCA1 expression is associated with worse prognosis of early breast cancer patients, especially the ones that received radiotherapy, indicating the potential use of PI3K inhibitors to reverse chemoresistance and radioresistance in ER-positive breast cancer patients.
--------
IHC staining showed that the expression of BARD1 and BRCA1 was significantly increased in the recurrent tamoxifen-resistant tumors than that in primary tumors (Fig. 6a, b), in agreement with the finding of upregulated BARD1 and BRCA1 in tamoxifen-resistant breast cancer cell lines.

--------
Interestingly, high BARD1 and BRCA1 expression was associated with poor prognosis in breast cancer patients receiving radiotherapy in Curtis data set, but had no significant prognostic effect in patients not receiving radiotherapy (Fig. 6e), further corroborating the notion that high BARD1 and BRCA1 expression results in resistance to DNA-damaging therapy including chemotherapy and radiotherapy.
--------
In contrast to the association between BRCA1/BARD1 mutation and increased risk of basal-like breast cancer, the analysis of multiple independent data sets showed that the expression of BARD1 and BRCA1 is associated with poor prognosis in ER-positive breast cancer patients, but not in ER-negative ones.
--------
Upregulated BARD1/BRCA1 in TamR breast cancer cells
--------
These findings indicated that GOT2 was a malignant metabolic driver in the absence of BRCA1 or ZBRK1 in BC.
--------
These observations provided a novel perspective for understanding how BRCA1 and ZBRK1 contribute to BC progression.
--------
Our findings revealed that BRCA1/ZBRK1 complex could have a function in aspartate metabolism, which was partially dependent on transcriptional regulation of GOT2. Importantly, GOT2 was overexpressed in breast cancer (BC), especially in triple‐negative breast cancer (TNBC), and was significantly correlated with poor survival of patients with these diseases.
--------
The potential feed‐forward loop of BRCA1/ZBRK1/GOT2 may be a crucial metabolic driver signaling BC progression.
--------
To verify this, we first confirmed that BRCA1 indeed physically interacted with ZBRK1 in mouse MEF‐BRCA1+/+ cells and human breast cancer cell lines MCF‐7 (Fig. 2D).

--------
To verify this, we first confirmed that BRCA1 indeed physically interacted with ZBRK1 in mouse MEF‐BRCA1+/+ cells and human breast cancer cell lines MCF‐7 (Fig. 2D).
--------
We report that BRCA1 forms a co‐repressor complex with ZBRK1 that coordinately represses GOT2 expression via a ZBRK1 recognition element in the promoter of GOT2. Impairment of this complex results in upregulation of GOT2, which in turn increases aspartate and alpha ketoglutarate production, leading to rapid cell proliferation of breast cancer cells.
--------
BRCA1/ZBRK1‐GOT2 axis is associated with clinicopathological characteristics of breast cancer
--------
As BRCA1 and ZBRK1 deficiency contributed to the progression of breast cancer, we supposed that this effect might be partially dependent on its functions in metabolism regulations.
--------
Collectively, these findings demonstrated the correlation between BRCA1/ZBRK1 and GOT2 in breast cancer samples and suggested the promising prognostic value of GOT2 in clinical practice.
--------
Maintaining redox balance and committing resources to biosynthesis should be essential for the proliferation of BRCA1‐deficient breast cancer cells.
--------
In summary, our findings reveal that BRCA1 modulates aspartate biosynthesis through transcriptional repression of GOT2, and provides a biological basis for treatment choices in breast cancer.
--------
Higher overexpression rates for CLDN3, 4, and 7 were found in BRCA1-related BC compared to sporadic BC [48].

Higher overexpression rates for CLDN3, 4, and 7 were found in BRCA1-related BC compared to sporadic BC [48].

We showed that CLDN3 was positively correlated with BRCA1-mutated BC.

(i) BRCA1-deficiency and BRCA1-low induce ATPME characterized by hypersialylation mediated by St8sia4 in premalignant mammary tissues and most human BRCA1ness breast cancers; (ii) The hypersialylation in mammary tissues is directed by the activation of Vegfa/Il6 mediated by TGFβ signals; (iii) The ATPME creates malignant niches that facilitate mammary tumor formation and metastasis; and (iv) Inhibition of ATPME blocks breast tumor metastasis in experimental models with hypersialylated mammary tissues.
--------
After screening several mammary tumor cell lines derived from Brca1-mutant mammary tumors, we found one cell line, 545, which expresses St8sia4 at a low level, and we also overexpressed St8sia4 into it to generate an isogenic pair of cell lines (545-Ctr and 545-OE-St8sia4; Fig. 3A).
--------
Consistent with a high level of vimentin level in mammary tissues carrying BRCA1 mutations, the undetermined cell fate was also observed with double positive of CK18 and CK14 mammary epithelial cells in both Brca1MKO mouse model (Fig. 1L and M) and patients with breast cancer (Fig. 1N and O).

--------
We demonstrated that ST8SIA4 is negatively regulated by BRCA1 and the hypersialylation on mammary epithelial cell surface induced by accumulation and overproduction of PSA sialic acid ligand in response to elevated sialyltransferase St8sia4 in both human and mouse mammary tissues harboring BRCA1 mutations and breast cancers with “no” or “low” levels of BRCA1.
--------
To study whether there is a correlation between BRCA1 and PSA, we conducted a TMA analysis of 95 human breast cancer samples and the data showed that 45 of them exhibited a high level of PSA (more than 50% positive signal, Supplementary Table S5) and positively correlated with ST8SIA4 (Supplementary Fig. S2F).
--------
The data revealed that the PSA level was elevated in both mice (Fig. 2B and C) and humans (Fig. 2D and E) with BRCA1 deficiency, and this was further supported by elevated PSA levels in Brca1MKO/FGFR2 double mutant mice, but not in mammary tumor tissues of MMTV-cNeu and FGFR2 mouse models (Supplementary Fig. S2E; ref. 42), showing that hypersialylation occurred inside these cells and on the cell membranes.

Here, we identified a mechanism mediated by sialyltransferases that induces an acidic tumor-permissive microenvironment (ATPME) in BRCA1-mutant and most BRCA1-low breast cancers.

Impaired mammary bilayer structures associated with elevated St8sia4 in BRCA1-deficient mice and patients with breast cancer
--------
In this study, the ATPME was detected in premalignant mammary glands and tumor tissues of Brca1MKO mice and BRCA1ness human breast cancer tissues.
--------
We demonstrated that ST8SIA4 is negatively regulated by BRCA1 and the hypersialylation on mammary epithelial cell surface induced by accumulation and overproduction of PSA sialic acid ligand in response to elevated sialyltransferase St8sia4 in both human and mouse mammary tissues harboring BRCA1 mutations and breast cancers with “no” or “low” levels of BRCA1.
--------
Consistent with its tumor-suppressor function, approximately 25% of mice carrying a mammary tissue–specific disruption of Brca1 mediated by MMTV-Cre (Brca1Co/Co; MMTV-Cre, or Brca1MKO) developed mammary tumors by 1.5 years (26) and about 20% of these mice developed metastasis in distant organs.
--------
Here, we identified a mechanism mediated by sialyltransferases that induces an acidic tumor-permissive microenvironment (ATPME) in BRCA1-mutant and most BRCA1-low breast cancers.

BRCA1 GPV carriers have a high incidence of basal-like BC and basal-like BC is derived from ER-negative and PR-negative luminal progenitor cells.

BRCA1 GPV carriers have a high incidence of basal-like BC and basal-like BC is derived from ER-negative and PR-negative luminal progenitor cells.
--------
Denosumab, a RANK-L inhibitor, has the potential to prevent BRCA1-associated BC, and clinical trials on denosumab are ongoing [67,68] (Figure 5).
--------
The resulting abnormal expansion of ER-negative luminal progenitors may be a target for other oncogenic hits, leading to basal-like BRCA1-associated BC formation [39,50].
--------
The mechanism of ESR1 transcriptional dysregulation due to BRCA1 dysfunction, resulting in basal-like BC has been previously reported [48] (Figure 5).
--------
BRCA1-associated BCs have a high frequency of basal-like and triple-negative BC (TNBC) derived from luminal progenitor cells.

We identified a correlation gene expression network and associated TFs in BRCA1/2-MUT BC to provide comprehensive and novel insights into the pathological mechanisms involved in BRCA1/2-MUT BC and the close relations between BRCA1/2 mutations and TNBC at a molecular level.

Notably, the highly connected genes identified in our study, denoted hub genes, showed sequential changes in expression levels from TNBC to BRCA1/2-MUT BC to BRCA1/2-WT BC, suggesting close relationships between BRCA1/2 mutations and TNBC at a molecular level.

--------
Moreover, orthotopic xenografts of BRCA1-mutant TNBC cell lines further confirmed that RNF8 confers survival of BRCA1-mutant TNBC tumors in vivo.
--------
We observed that RNF8 depletion significantly impaired the growth of BRCA1 mutant MDA-MB-436 TNBC cells and BRCA2 mutant Kuramochi ovarian cancer cell line (Figure 1B and Supplementary Figure S2a).
--------
We demonstrated that RNF8 is enriched at R-loop-prone genomic loci, particularly TTS, and that RNF8 deficiency in BRCA1-mutant TNBC cells resulted in R-loop accumulation and DNA damage at those R-loop enriched sites.
--------
Moreover, orthotopic xenografts of BRCA1-mutant TNBC cell lines further confirmed that RNF8 confers survival of BRCA1-mutant TNBC tumors in vivo.
--------
These data also indicated that RNF8 depletion in BRCA1-mutant TNBC cells deregulates several vital cellular processes, thus leading to increased transcription-replication collisions and defective growth of TNBC cells.
--------
Supporting a role for the aberrant R-loop accumulation in promoting replication stress and genomic instability in RNF8 depleted BRCA1 mutant TNBC cells, treatment of these cells with the replication inhibitors aphidicolin and actinomycin D significantly reduced their levels of DNA damage.
--------
To further determine the effect of RNF8 deficiency on the capacity of BRCA1 mutant TNBC cells to repair DSBs, MDA-MB-436 cells with or without RNF8 knockdown were analyzed using well characterized I-SceI based DSB repair reporter assays (20,21) (Supplementary Figure S4).
--------
These data also indicated that RNF8 depletion in BRCA1-mutant TNBC cells deregulates several vital cellular processes, thus leading to increased transcription-replication collisions and defective growth of TNBC cells.
--------
Given that RNF8 loss resulted in defective in vitro growth of BRCA1-deficient TNBC cells, we explored the effect of RNF8 depletion on the in vivo growth of these cells.
--------
Moreover, orthotopic xenografts of BRCA1-mutant TNBC cell lines further confirmed that RNF8 confers survival of BRCA1-mutant TNBC tumors in vivo.
--------
To validate this observation, we depleted RNF8 in the BRCA1-mutant TNBC cell lines (MDA-MB-436 and SUM149PT), and BRCA2-mutant ovarian cancer cell lines (Kuramochi and PEO1) and examined their level of DNA damage.
--------
The elevated level of DNA damage upon RNF8 knockdown in BRCA1-mutant TNBC cells is transcription dependent as it was reversed in response to treatment with the transcription inhibitors Flavopiridol and actinomycin D. This suggests that aberrant transcription in the absence of RNF8 and BRCA1 promotes the accumulation of R-loops and increases genomic instability.
--------
Additionally, we investigated the potential of curcumin to suppress miR-155-5p in BRCA1-deficient breast cancer cell lines.
--------
Here, we provide evidence for the targeted anticancer activity of PB against BRCA1 mutated breast cancer cells in vitro as well as in GEMM (Genetically Engineered Mouse Models) of BRCA1 mutated mammary tumor.
--------
Here, we provide evidence for the targeted anticancer activity of PB against BRCA1 mutated breast cancer cells in vitro as well as in GEMM (Genetically Engineered Mouse Models) of BRCA1 mutated mammary tumor.
--------
Hence, these data demonstrate that the ectopic expression of full length BRCA1 resulted in decreased sensitivity towards PB in BRCA1 mutated breast cancer cells.
--------
These results corroborate that PB induces cytotoxicity at a lower concentration in BRCA1 defective breast cancer cells in comparison to malignant as well as nonmalignant breast cells expressing wild type BRCA1.
--------
We have earlier shown that Plumbagin (PB) can induce selective cytotoxicity to BRCA1 defective ovarian cancer cells; however, the effect of this molecule in BRCA1 mutated breast cancers has not been analyzed yet.

Wild type BRCA1 reconstitution reduces the sensitivity towards PB in BRCA1 mutated breast cancer cells

Conditional transgenic models of BRCA1 mutant breast cancers have not been used widely in preclinical trials except for the study of K14-Cre; BRCA1fl/fl mouse in testing the efficacy of Olaparib43 and Topotecan44, wherein BRCA1 5-14 exon floxed animals were used.

Hence, these data demonstrate that the ectopic expression of full length BRCA1 resulted in decreased sensitivity towards PB in BRCA1 mutated breast cancer cells.
--------
PB reduces DNA- dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) expression and inhibits NHEJ (Non Homologous End Joining) activity in BRCA1 defective breast cancer cells.
--------
This is because the ALDH1+ cells from BRCA1-defective cell lines formed large mammospheres in comparison to ALDH1+ cells from BRCA1-competent breast cancer cells.

Earlier studies from our group have revealed the ability of PB (5-hydroxy-2-methyl-1, 4-naphthoquinone) to selectively target BRCA1-defective ovarian cancer cells [21–24] as well as BRCA1-knockout breast cancer xenografts (unpublished data).
--------
The use of the three established methods for isolation of CSCs followed by in vitro self renewal analysis by mammosphere formation studies have thus brought out the ALDH1+ phenotype as the best candidate putative stem cell marker for BRCA1-defective breast cancer cells.

Earlier studies from our group have revealed the ability of PB (5-hydroxy-2-methyl-1, 4-naphthoquinone) to selectively target BRCA1-defective ovarian cancer cells [21–24] as well as BRCA1-knockout breast cancer xenografts (unpublished data).
--------
Hence, ALDH1, as a BCSC marker showed a specific association with BRCA1-defective breast cancers and BRCA1 has a cardinal effect on BCSC numbers and properties.
--------
We demonstrate for the first time that a naphthoquinone, PB selectively reduces the ALDH1+ population in basal-like BRCA1-defective breast cancer cells while enriching the ALDH1+ population in cancer cells harboring full length, functional BRCA1, the reason for which has to be analyzed in future.
--------
BRCA1 status was observed to be a determinant of the abundance of epithelial-like (ALDH1+) or mesenchymal-like (CD44+/24–/low) BCSCs, and the reconstitution of a full length, wild type BRCA1 in HCC1937 breast cancer cells possessing a mutated BRCA1, transforms them from ‘stem-like’ to more ‘mesenchymal’.
--------
We now went on to study if PB that has been shown to the selective to BRCA1-defective ovarian cancer cells [23] could also selectively target BRCA1-defective basal-like breast cancer cells.
--------
Selective mode of action of plumbagin through BRCA1 deficient breast cancer stem cells

We have confirmed that ALDH1 positivity is the best marker for the identification of BCSCs in BRCA1-defective breast cancer cell lines when compared to the CD marker profile and Side Population (SP) analysis.
--------
BRCA1 status was observed to be a determinant of the abundance of epithelial-like (ALDH1+) or mesenchymal-like (CD44+/24–/low) BCSCs, and the reconstitution of a full length, wild type BRCA1 in HCC1937 breast cancer cells possessing a mutated BRCA1, transforms them from ‘stem-like’ to more ‘mesenchymal’.
--------
Thus, future studies aimed at targeted delivery of PB into BRCA1-defective breast cancers could open up new avenues for the complete abrogation of the cancer, including CSCs, aiding relapse-free survival after chemotherapy.
--------
A similar link was also observed between the CD44+/24–/low profile and BRCA1 expression status in basal–like breast cancer cells, as HCC1937 expressed higher CD44+/24–/low cells than the HCC1937/wt BRCA1 cell line.
--------
Plumbagin shows selective sensitivity for BRCA1 defective breast cancer cells
--------
This is the maiden study addressing the ability of PB to target CSCs with selectivity for BCSCs from BRCA1-defective breast cancer cell lines.
--------
Here we report that ALDH1 positivity could be one of the best markers for the identification of BCSCs from basal-like, BRCA1-defective breast cancer cell lines based on the isolation of putative CSCs followed by their in vitro mammosphere culture.
--------
This paves way for further xenograft experiments with BRCA1-defective breast cancer cell lines which could bring out the specific and pronounced effects of PB in BRCA1-defective BCSCs as is expected from the in vitro and in vivo data generated from this study.
--------
We now went on to study if PB that has been shown to the selective to BRCA1-defective ovarian cancer cells [23] could also selectively target BRCA1-defective basal-like breast cancer cells.
--------
Expression was also detected in RNA isolated from Brca1-/- mouse mammary tumors: Bcl11a was detected in seven of eight tumors, and Sox11 was detected in two of eight tumors (see Additional file 20).
--------
Next, we interrogated the embryonic-enriched mammary epithelial signature expression in mammary tumors that formed in mouse strains in which Brca1 had been deleted in either mammary epithelial luminal progenitors (Blg-Cre Brca1f/f p53+/-) or in basal cells, including basal stem cells (K14-Cre Brca1f/f p53+/-) [12], to determine whether the embryonic signature is activated in a validated mouse model of triple-negative breast cancer [31].
--------
We looked for activation of the embryonic mammary epithelial signature in mouse mammary tumors that formed in mice in which Brca1 had been conditionally deleted from the mammary epithelium and in human breast cancers to determine whether any genetic links exist between embryonic mammary cells and breast cancers.
--------
Four transcription factors (Bcl11a, Grhl3, Prox1, Sox11) activated in Brca1-/- mouse tumors and basal-like human breast cancers across multiple datasets were chosen for validation studies, and all were confirmed to be embryonic-enriched and highly expressed by some tumors.
--------
Tumor-associated embryonic mammary transcriptional regulators are expressed in invasive Brca1-/- mammary tumor cells
--------
Small subsets of the embryonic mammary epithelial signature were consistently activated in mouse Brca1-/- tumors and human basal-like breast cancers, which encoded predominantly transcriptional regulators, cell-cycle, and actin cytoskeleton components.
--------
A small component of the embryonic-specific mammary signature appears activated in mouse Brca1-/- tumors and in approximately 80% of human basal-like breast cancers in the datasets we examined.
--------
Five genes are found activated in the mouse Brca1-/- tumor dataset and the three breast cancer datasets, predominantly in basal-like cancers; statistical analysis indicated significant enrichment of these genes (see Additional file 9).
--------
We looked for activation of the embryonic mammary epithelial signature in mouse mammary tumors that formed in mice in which Brca1 had been conditionally deleted from the mammary epithelium and in human breast cancers to determine whether any genetic links exist between embryonic mammary cells and breast cancers.
--------
We conclude that several signature components identified in our cancer dataset analysis are highly embryonic enriched, expressed at sites of active tissue remodeling in vivo during embryonic mammary development and in many Brca1-/- mammary tumors.
--------
Among them, the transcription factor, SOX11, a progenitor cell and lineage regulator of nonmammary cell types, is found highly expressed in some Brca1-/- mammary tumors.
--------
We looked for activation of the embryonic mammary epithelial signature in mouse mammary tumors that formed in mice in which Brca1 had been conditionally deleted from the mammary epithelium and in human breast cancers to determine whether any genetic links exist between embryonic mammary cells and breast cancers.
--------
Antibody staining found Sox11 highly expressed at the invasion front in some Brca1-/- mammary tumors.
--------
Embryonic mammary signature subsets are activated in Brca1-/- and basal-like breast cancers
--------
Because of the embryonic lethality of homozygous animals carrying two defective Brca1 alleles and the lack of mammary tumour development in heterozygous mice carrying one defective and one wild-type Brca1 allele, these models could not be used to study the role of BRCA1 in tumorigenesis.
--------
Because of their strong resemblance to human BRCA1-related breast cancer, especially the mouse models of Liu and McCarthy should prove useful in preclinical therapeutic intervention studies.
--------
For instance, nearly all existing mouse models for BRCA1-associated breast cancer described earlier are based on co-mutation of Trp53 and Brca1. It might be possible that mutations in yet other genes, such as Pten (Saal et al, 2008), are required to effectively model BRCA1-mutated breast cancer in mice.

--------
Although conventional Brca1 mouse models have enabled us to learn a lot about the biological functions of BRCA1, the observed embryonic lethality of homozygous animals and lack of mammary tumour development in heterozygous mice made it difficult to study the role of BRCA1 in tumour suppression.
--------
With regard to this time issue, conditional Brca1 mouse models that develop mammary tumours with strong resemblance to human BRCA1-mutated breast tumours (Liu et al, 2007; McCarthy et al, 2007) can be very helpful in predicting response and resistance to conventional and targeted therapeutics.
--------
It may therefore be important to evaluate the effects of PR antagonists in Brca1 mouse models that certainly recapitulate development of triple-negative BRCA1-associated breast cancer.
--------
In contrast to women with heterozygous BRCA1 germline mutations, none of the heterozygous Brca1 mouse mutants developed spontaneous mammary tumours.
--------
Before elaborating on the Brca1 conventional and conditional mouse models that have been generated to date, we will discuss the characteristics of human BRCA1-related breast cancer in more detail.

Mouse models for BRCA1-related breast cancer

The most recently developed conditional Brca1 mammary tumour models closely mimic several important aspects of human BRCA1-associated breast cancer and therefore serve as important tools for the development of novel therapies for this disease.

--------
Of course, current mouse models are not perfect yet and can still be further improved to closely mimic additional aspects of human BRCA1-related breast cancer, to study, for example, the role of genetic reversion in therapy resistance.
--------
Another mouse model for basal-like breast cancer was generated by conditional deletion of Brca1 exons 22–24 (which harbour the second BRCT domain) in the mammary gland by using β-lactoglobin (BLG)-cre (McCarthy et al, 2007).

Preclinical mouse models for BRCA1-associated breast cancer

--------
In the past years, these mouse models have been further improved to recapitulate the salient features of human BRCA1-associated breast cancer, such as ‘triple-negative’ status, increased genomic instability and increased expression of basal epithelial markers.
--------
In this review, we will discuss the insights into BRCA1 functions that we obtained from mouse models with conventional and conditional mutations in Brca1. The most advanced models closely resemble human BRCA1-related breast cancer and may therefore be useful for addressing clinically relevant questions.

Recapitulation of these characteristics in mouse models is crucial for preclinical development of chemoprevention strategies and tailored therapies for BRCA1-associated breast cancer.

--------
We also included a novel basal-like breast cancer mouse model we established recently with loss of Trp53 and Brca1 [38].
--------
We chose 2 organoid lines from this biobank, 74T and 86T, which represent a luminal and a basal-like breast cancer line with low and high level of a BRCA1-deficiency signature (i.e., signature 3), respectively [50].
--------
Our previous study showed that the mutated mammary epithelial cells underwent luminal to basal/mesenchymal cell fate change in p53/BRCA1-deficient breast cancer mouse model [38].
--------
This approach somatically inactivates Brca1 and Trp53 in luminal mammary epithelial cells, including luminal progenitors (LPs), which are believed to serve as the cellular origin of BRCA1-associated basal-like breast cancer [40–42]; we showed by single-cell analysis in this model that LPs were the target luminal mammary epithelial subset that underwent expansion, eventually leading to development of mammary tumors that closely resemble the human basal-like breast cancer subtype [38].

TcdBFBD treatment greatly reduced sphere formation of p53/BRCA1-deficient mammary tumor cells (Fig 5A).

--------
For example, messenger RNA expression is similarly up- or down-regulated in some genes (e.g., AKT3, CCNE1, MYC, RB1) and high mutation rates in specific genes (e.g., BRCA1, RB1, TP53) are observed in both TNBC and ovarian cancer [28, 29].
--------
Conditional in vivo deletion of LYN kinase has little effect on a BRCA1 loss-of-function-associated mammary tumour model
--------
LYN is overexpressed in human triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC; the breast cancer subtype most strongly associated with BRCA1 loss) (Choi et al., 2010; Croucher et al., 2013; Hochgrafe et al., 2010; Molyneux et al., 2010) and is also expressed at high levels in mammary tumours from Brca1 conditional knockout mice (Molyneux et al., 2010).
--------
Our findings suggested that functional LYN kinase was required for survival of BRCA1-null mammary tumour cells (Tornillo et al., 2018).
--------
Downstream mediators linked to LYN activation of NFκB include MEK, IKKα (or CHUK) (Cooper et al., 2013), PI3K (Toubiana et al., 2015), MAPK and IκB (Avila et al., 2012), and there is also support for a role of NFκB activation in BRCA1 loss-of-function-associated breast cancers.
--------
We have directly demonstrated using human breast cancer cell lines, primary cultures from Brca1-deleted mouse mammary tumours and cultures from human BRCA1-null patient-derived breast cancer xenografts that BRCA1 loss results in activation of LYN and downstream pathways, including the AKT pathway, and confers a growth and survival advantage to mammary tumour cells (Tornillo et al., 2018).

--------
We hypothesised that as LYN kinase activity was required for survival of cells that had lost BRCA1 activity (Tornillo et al., 2018), introducing the conditional Lynfl(ex4) allele into the BlgCre Brca1fl/fl p53+/− background would result in a significant increase in overall survival (i.e. the age at which mice had to be euthanised for any reason) and also in mammary tumour-specific survival (i.e. the age at which mice had to be euthanised specifically as a result of the size of a mammary tumour).
--------
Comparison of Brca1 tumour cohorts showed little difference in mammary tumour formation between animals that were wild type, heterozygous or homozygous for the conditional Lyn allele, although this was confounded by factors including incomplete Lyn recombination in some tumours.

LYN kinase is expressed in BRCA1 loss-of-function-dependent mouse mammary tumours, in the cells of origin of such tumours, and in human breast cancer.

--------
The cells of origin of BRCA1-associated mammary tumours, the mammary luminal epithelial estrogen receptor (ESR1)-negative stem/progenitor population, express the c-KIT (or KIT) receptor tyrosine kinase at high levels, as well as its downstream pathway member, the SRC-family kinase LYN (Regan et al., 2012; Tornillo et al., 2018).
--------
LYN kinase is expressed in BRCA1 loss-of-function-dependent mouse mammary tumours, in the cells of origin of such tumours, and in human breast cancer.
--------
Suppressing LYN kinase activity in BRCA1-defective cell lines as well as in in vitro cultures of Brca1-null mouse mammary tumours is deleterious to their growth.
--------
Here, we examined the interaction between LYN kinase and BRCA1 loss-of-function in an in vivo mouse mammary tumour model, using conditional knockout Brca1 and Lyn alleles.
--------
Suppressing LYN kinase activity in BRCA1-defective cell lines as well as in in vitro cultures of Brca1-null mouse mammary tumours is deleterious to their growth.
--------
In clinics, basal BC patients harboring an alteration of networks involving BRCA1 and TP53 would be suggested by the BRCA1/TP53- targeting drugs.
--------
We found that CD44+/CD24- Brca1-deficient mouse mammary tumor cells have cancer stem cell characteristics in vitro, and 50 of these cells are sufficient to initiate tumors in mice.
--------
Brca1-deficient mouse mammary tumors harbor heterogeneous cancer stem cell populations, and CD44+/CD24- cells represent a population that correlates with human breast cancer stem cells.
--------
Brca1-deficient mouse mammary tumors harbor heterogeneous cancer stem cell populations, and CD44+/CD24- cells represent a population that correlates with human breast cancer stem cells.
--------
To determine whether Brca1 cell lines contain a distinct population of cancer stem cells, we examined expression of cell surface markers previously assigned to human breast cancer stem cells, namely CD44 and CD24.
--------
We found that that same Brca1-deficient genetic background gave rise to mammary tumors with two distinct and non-overlapping populations of cells that bear cell surface markers previously assigned to tumor-initiating cells from human breast and other organs.
--------
Thus, individual Brca1-deficient mouse mammary tumors gave rise to cell lines with distinct populations of cells expressing stem cell markers.
--------
However, the Brca1 deficient mouse mammary tumors have variable penetrance and latency, which makes it nearly impossible to use these models to standardize therapies and to study the stem cell population.
--------
Second, some Brca1-deficient tumors contain CD44+/CD24-/Low cells, previously associated with human breast cancer stem cells [10,11,28], whereas others contain CD133+ cells previously associated with tumors in other organs [29].
--------
Brca1-deficient mouse mammary tumors harbor heterogeneous cancer stem cell populations, and CD44+/CD24- cells also identify human breast cancer stem cells.
--------
First, Brca1-deficient mouse mammary tumors contain heterogeneous populations of cells that share cancer stem cell properties.
--------
Brca1-deficient mouse mammary tumors harbor heterogeneous cancer stem cell populations, and CD44+/CD24- cells also identify human breast cancer stem cells.
--------
Gene expression analysis of individual Brca1 mammary tumors and their subsequent passages in vivo revealed substantial heterogeneity in gene expression [40], as predicted by differences in frequency and identity of cancer stem cell populations in cell lines derived from these tumors.
--------
Characterization of cell lines from Brca1 mouse mammary tumors
--------
We also tested whether Brca1 cells express CD133, a marker not previously described in association with breast cancer, but shown to mark cancer stem cells in other tumors.
--------
Whether cancer stem cells occur in BRCA1-associated breast cancer and contribute to therapeutic response is not known.
--------
Cell lines derived from individual Brca1 mouse mammary tumors had distinct and non-overlapping populations of putative cancer stem cell markers CD44+/CD24- and CD133+.
--------
Therefore, maybe there are functional connections between BRCA1, PPARγ and PFKP in glycolysis system and PFKP inhibitor may have a potential effect on BRCA1 dysfunctional breast cancer patients who suffer from diabetes and need treatments with PPARγ agonists.
--------
Our study provided a new insight into the dysregulation of glycolysis in breast cancer, which might be partially due to the deficiency of BRCA1/ZBRK1 axis and subsequently reversed the transcriptional repressive effect on PFKP.
--------
Furthermore, when we overexpressed BRCA1 in HCC1937 cell line (a BRCA1 deficient breast cancer cell line), there was a notable suppression of PFKP expression in both protein and mRNA level upon BRCA1 overexpression (Fig 2G).
--------
Therefore, maybe there are functional connections between BRCA1, PPARγ and PFKP in glycolysis system and PFKP inhibitor may have a potential effect on BRCA1 dysfunctional breast cancer patients who suffer from diabetes and need treatments with PPARγ agonists.
--------
The results showed that BRCA1 insufficient breast cancer cells were more vulnerable to glucose deprivation (Fig 1D and 1E), and consumed more glucose than their control group (Fig 1F and S1 Fig).
--------
In addition, Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) was overexpressed in BRCA1-defective breast cancer patients, and in vascular smooth muscle cells PPARγ was found to regulate PFKP [49, 50].
--------
To further verify the relationship between BRCA1 and glucose dependence or consumption in breast cancer cells, we knocked down BRCA1 in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cell lines and repeated above experiments.
--------
Given that we have illustrated that dysfunction of BRCA1 or ZBRK1 led to the overexpression of PFKP and subsequently enhanced aerobic glycolysis and the malignant phenotype of breast cancer, it is worthy to elucidate the underlying mechanism that how BRCA1 exerts its functions in regulating the balance of EMT and rapid aerobic glycolysis to meet different situations.
--------
PFKP is transcriptionally repressed by BRCA1/ZBRK1 and predicts prognosis in breast cancer
--------
The present study aims to elucidate the underlying mechanism how PFKP is regulated by BRCA1 and the clinical significance of PFKP in breast cancer.
--------
As PFKP was regulated by BRCA1/ZBRK1 axis, we next explored what the role of PFKP in cell growth and colony formation in breast cancer cells MDA-MB-231.
--------
In summary, our results indicate that BRCA1/ZBRK1 affects the transcriptional regulation of PFKP, providing important evidence for the understanding of abnormal mechanism of breast cancer glycolysis.
--------
Furthermore, when we overexpressed BRCA1 in HCC1937 cell line (a BRCA1 deficient breast cancer cell line), there was a notable suppression of PFKP expression in both protein and mRNA level upon BRCA1 overexpression (Fig 2G).
--------
BRCA1 is required for the transactivation of ESR1, the gene encoding for ERα, and studies have demonstrated that the exogenous expression of functional BRCA1 into BRCA1-mutated/ER-negative BC cells (HCC1937) significantly increases ERα protein levels [52].
--------
The BRCA1 protein is a necessary factor for the transactivation of ESR1. Previous studies demonstrated that the transfection of ERα-positive BC cells with siRNA against BRCA1 silenced the expression of ESR1, whereas the ectopic expression of a wild-type BRCA1 construct into the BRCA1-mutated/ERα-negative HCC1937 cell line rescued the ERα protein [52].
--------
Pre-pubertal GEN exposure (500 ppm) was shown to increase Brca1 expression and decrease DMBA-induced mammary tumor incidence and aggressiveness in mice [35].
--------
As a control, we determined that the stimulatory effects of GAL on BRCA1 protein levels were also associated a with a decrease (~25%) in BRCA1 promoter methylation (Figure 4B, p = 0.02), based on the information that GEN is an antagonist of AHR transcriptional activity in colon cancer cells [50] and a dual agonist/antagonist in ER + BC cells [51].

--------
The dietary isoflavone genistein (GEN) modulates BRCA1 CpG methylation in BC cells.
--------
We recently reported that GEN prevents BRCA1 hypermethylation in ERα-positive MCF7 BC cells treated with the AHR agonist TCDD, and reverses constitutive BRCA1 CpG methylation in ERα-negative HER2-enriched cells with constitutive high levels of AHR [42].

--------
Epigenetic Activation of BRCA1 by Genistein In Vivo and Triple Negative Breast Cancer Cells Linked to Antagonism toward Aryl Hydrocarbon Receptor
--------
Specifically, we found that GEN prevented BRCA1 CpG hypermethylation in ERα-positive BC cells treated with an AHR agonist as well as reversed constitutive BRCA1 CpG methylation in ERα-negative HER2-enriched cells with high levels of AHR [42].
--------
Interestingly, the anti-mammary tumor effects of GEN are not observed in Brca1+/− mice, possibly suggesting a requirement for coincident Brca1 expression.
--------
Our data suggest that lifetime GEN may decrease BC risk in mice by decreasing basal Brca1 promoter methylation.
--------
Hence, apart from germline or somatic BRCA1 mutations, BRCA1 hypermethylation [12–15] and/or loss of heterozygosity (LOH) [16, 17] may give rise to a BRCA1-like molecular profile in TNBC.

--------
Their research suggested that increasing the cells expressing ALDH1, because of knockdown of BRCA1 in breast epithelial cells, can be considered as a breast cancer prevention (29).
--------
There was a clear inverse correlation between the intensity of CD44 expression and BRCA1 nuclear expression in this series of breast cancers, indicating that higher expression of BRCA1 was associated with lower CD44 expression (p=0.04).
--------
Other studies have also demonstrated an association between BRCA1 hereditary breast cancer and the presence of CD44+/CD24- cells (35, 36), whereas our study points to the relationship between BRCA1 and CSC marker CD44 in unselected breast cancer patients rather than only in hereditary breast cancer patients.

--------
Wright et al., using 16 cell lines from distinct BRCA1 deficient mouse mammary tumours , found that these tumours harbor heterogeneous CSC populations and that CD44+/ CD24- cells represent a population that correlates with human breast CSCs (18).
--------
The clinicopatho- logical features of breast cancer in BRCA1 mutation carriers suggest that BRCA1 may function as a stem-cell regulator.
--------
Recent evidence supports the hypothesis that BRCA1 is involved in breast cancer functions as a breast stem cell regulator (11, 12, 25).
--------
Other studies have also demonstrated an association between BRCA1 hereditary breast cancer and the presence of CD44+/CD24- cells (35, 36), whereas our study points to the relationship between BRCA1 and CSC marker CD44 in unselected breast cancer patients rather than only in hereditary breast cancer patients.

--------
In multiple experimental systems, including primary mammary tumors, cultured human cells, and Brca1-deficient mice, Shukla and colleagues showed that BRCA1 deficiency resulted in increased expression of insulin-like growth factor receptor substrate 1 (IRS1), insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (IGF1R), IGFBP2, and increased levels of serum IGF1 [19].

Somatic loss of both BRCA1 and p53 resulted in the rapid and efficient formation of highly proliferative, poorly differentiated, estrogen receptor-negative mammary carcinomas with pushing borders and increased expression of basal epithelial markers, reminiscent of human basal-like breast cancer.

--------
Additionally, migration of breast cancer cells in response to CM of ADSCs proved to be equivalent or slower for BRCA1/2 mutated versus nonmutated cancer cells and, with exception of angiopoietin-like 2, induced expression of adipokines showed no major difference.
--------
The breast cancer cell lines were stimulated with CM of a large panel of ADSCs and the BRCA1-mutated cell lines revealed no higher proliferation compared to the matching wild-type breast cancer cells.
--------
This BRCA1-negative ADSCs were reported to induce a more aggressive phenotype in MDA-MB-231, that is already recognized as highly invasive breast cancer cell line.
--------
A range of adipokine-related markers were analyzed in the wildtype and BRCA1-mutated breast cancer cell lines exposed to ADSC-CM.
--------
One investigation studied the effect of an ADSC line in which BRCA1 was eliminated using the CRISPR/Cas9 technique on the interaction with wildtype MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells [11].
--------
The present study compared the interaction of adipose-derived stromal cells (ADSCs) on wildtype and BRCA1-mutated breast cancer cell lines and found no increased protumor effects of CM of ADSCs.

Effects of media conditioned by normal ADSCs showed largely comparable effects on BRCA1-mutated and wildtype breast cancer cell lines thus advocating lipofilling, preferentially employing allogeneic non-mutated ADSCs.
--------
The present investigation studied the effects of wildtype ADSCs on wildtype and BRCA1-mutated breast cancer cell lines and found no major difference of the effects of CM derived from a panel of ADSCs.
--------
Possibly, the CpG demethylating effects of GEN and EGCG could be due to reduced DNMT-1 expression (29) and activity on BRCA1 (20) and ESR1, as recently reported in ERα-negative breast cancer cells (54).
--------
In summary, the results of this study suggest preventative effects for GEN and EGCG against proliferation and AhR-mediated BRCA1 CpG methylation in ERα-positive breast cancer cells.
--------
Evidence that it induces BRCA-1 expression in ERα-positive breast cancer cells suggests potential relevance for this isoflavone in cancer prevention (25).
--------
Objectives: We investigated the regulation of BRCA1 by the soy isoflavone genistein (GEN) in human estrogen receptor α (ERα)–positive Michigan Cancer Foundation-7 (MCF-7) and ERα-negative sporadic University of Arizona Cell Culture-3199 (UACC-3199) breast cancer cells, respectively, with inducible and constitutively active AhR.
--------
In previous studies, similar concentrations (0.5–1.0 μM) of GEN were shown to stimulate BRCA-1 expression in breast cancer cells (25).
--------
Conclusions: Results suggest preventative effects for GEN and EGCG against BRCA1 CpG methylation and downregulation in ERα-positive breast cancer cells with activated AhR.
--------
In follow-up experiments, we examined the time-dependent effects of GEN at the 1-μM concentration, which approaches the serum concentration of GEN measured in persons with habitual soy intake and is known to induce BRCA-1 expression in breast cancer cells (25).
--------
Here, we investigated the impact of GEN and (–)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) control on BRCA-1 methylation and expression in a human ERα-positive breast cancer cell line (MCF-7) with inducible AhR and hypomethylated BRCA1. We extended the BRCA-1 expression and DNA methylation studies with GEN and α-naphthoflavone (αNF; 7,8-benzoflavone), a synthetic flavone and AhR antagonist, to a human ERα-negative cell line model University of Arizona Cell Culture-3199 (UACC-3199) of sporadic breast cancer harboring constitutively activated AhR and hypermethylated BRCA1 (4).

Immunofluorescence analysis confirmed that both pre-pregnancy mammary tumors and post-pregnancy normal mammary tissue were indeed deficient for Brca1+ epithelial cells, indicating that the lack of mammary tumors in parous female mice was not due to inefficient Brca1 deletion (Figure S7C).
--------
Therefore, we developed an inducible mouse model of Brca1 loss of function, for the purpose of investigating how pregnancy-induced changes influence Brca1-null mammary tumor development.

Therefore, we developed an inducible mouse model of Brca1 loss of function, for the purpose of investigating how pregnancy-induced changes influence Brca1-null mammary tumor development.
--------
Given that we demonstrated that pregnancy-induced changes block mammary oncogenesis in two distinct models (Figure 4), and that cMyc gain of function is commonly found in Brca1-mutated breast cancers, we utilized the cMyc overexpression mouse model to further characterize the effects of the immune microenvironment on the malignant development of post-pregnancy MECs.
--------
Brca1KO mammary tumors display cellular and molecular features similar to those previously described in human breast tissue from BRCA1 mutation carriers and animal models of Brca1 loss of function, including high EGFR and KRT17 protein levels and altered copy-number variation marked by gains and losses of genomic regions (Annunziato et al., 2019) (Figures S6I and S6J).
--------
Nulliparous Brca1KO mice exhibited signs of mammary hyperplasia approximately 12 weeks post-TAM treatment, which gradually progressed into mammary tumors at around 20 weeks after Brca1 deletion (Figures S6G and S6H).

Ghosh et al. have reported that BRCA1 suppresses the transcriptional activity of the breast cancer-associated aromatase promoter in normal ASCs, thus lending further support to the notion that elevated synthesis of estrogen within tumor adipose tissue contributes to the growth of postmenopausal breast cancer [64].

The interaction of BRCA1 and estrogen receptor α (ER-α) was observed in MCF-10A breast epithelial cells and MCF-7 breast cancer cells.

Heterozygous BRCA1 mutations in mammary tissue microenvironment might create a pro-tumorigenic niche, which may significantly contribute to breast cancer development in carriers of germline BRCA1 mutations.
--------
It is likely that defective HR, compromised genomic integrity, repeated exposure to hormonally driven ROS, and acquisition of additional mutations, all contribute to breast cancer initiation associated with mutations or loss of function of BRCA1.
--------
The fact that breast cancer development in BRCA1-mutation carriers is crucially affected by female sex hormones led to the question whether RANK/RANKL, which are key molecules in the mammary gland downstream of steroid hormones, have a role in the aetiology of BRCA1 mutation-driven breast cancer.

Furthermore, it was shown, that serum levels of RANKL and its decoy receptor OPG are deregulated in BRCA1-mutation carriers, lower OPG serum levels being associated with an increased risk of breast cancer [66].

--------
Most importantly, we were also able to experimentally show that RANKL blockade could be used as a preventive strategy in BRCA1-mutation carriers: RANKL blockade in mice carrying a Bcra1 mutation markedly abrogated the occurrence of pre-neoplastic lesions, and after 1 year of treatment only 1 out 13 Brca1-mutant mice showed mammary epithelial neoplasia whereas nearly all untreated control mice developed mammary tumours.
--------
Recently, we and others were able to show that RANK and RANKL are also critical regulators of BRCA1-mutation-driven breast cancer.
--------
Of note, p53, which is often mutated in women with BRCA1-associated breast cancer, is a known negative regulator of mammary stem cells and deletion of p53 results in the expansion of stem cells in vitro and in vivo [54,55].
--------
Recently, we provided direct genetic evidence for the role of RANK/RANKL in Brca1 mutation-driven breast cancer [70].

As our work strongly implicates RANK and RANKL as key molecules involved in the initiation of BRCA1-associated breast cancer, we propose that anti-RANKL therapy could be a feasible preventive strategy for women carrying BRCA1 mutations, and by extension to other women with high risk of breast cancer.

A direct effect of progesterone on Brca1-associated breast cancer was demonstrated in studies on Brca1;p53 deficient mice; administration of the progesterone antagonist mifepristone markedly blocked tumour development in this mouse model [64].

Most recently, we and others provided genetic and functional evidence for the critical function of RANK/RANKL in the development of familial BRCA1-mutated breast cancer.
--------
A first hint that RANK/RANKL might indeed be involved in the pathogenesis of BRCA1-mutated breast cancer came from studies of sex hormone titres in women with a BRCA1 mutation.
--------
Thus, RANKL inhibition using an approved drug might be a feasible strategy to, for the first time, prevent breast cancer in BRCA1-mutation carriers and possibly in other women at high risk for developing breast cancer.
--------
These functions of RANK and RANKL range from bone turnover to immune regulation, development of secondary lymphoid organs, fever regulation, regulation of bone metastases, and, importantly for this review, the establishment of a lactating mammary gland and the development of hormone- and Brca1 mutation-induced mammary tumours.

Progesterone receptor (PR) expression is found to be consistent with ER expression and mutations in the BRCA1 gene, a tumor-suppressor gene, are known to be responsible for about 40%–45% of hereditary breast cancers.

Western blot analysis displayed significant alterations of ER-α, PR, and BRCA1 protein levels after 24-hour treatment with 80–500 μM BC.
--------
Effects of BC on the cellular localization of BRCA1
--------
It has previously been demonstrated that BRCA1-related breast cancer patients have a higher risk of developing cancer in estrogen-sensitive tissues.25 It is suggested that ER-α and BRCA1 signal together through crosstalk mechanisms and these interactions may contribute to breast tumorigenesis and/or growth in the presence of estrogen.
--------
Our findings contribute to a better understanding of the effects of BC not only on ER-α expression but also on PR and BRCA1 expression in breast cancer cells.

Here we report that two non-calcemic analogues of 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, seocalcitol (EB1089) and QW-1624F2-2, collaborate with BRCA1 in mediating growth inhibition of breast cancer cells and breast cancer stem-like cells.

--------
Effect of 1,25(OH)2D3 analogues on growth of BRCA1-deficient and proficient breast cancer cells
--------
Although BRCA1-silenced MCF7 and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells are still responsive to vitamin D3, as reflected by Cyp24A1 mRNA induction, the G1/G0 checkpoint and p21waf1 induction were impaired despite similar expression leveles of vitamin D receptor (VDR) and its dimerization partner protein, RXR.
--------
Here we report for the first time that BRCA1 is critical for vitamin D3-mediated growth inhibition of breast cancer cells via co-regulation of cell cycle progression and p21waf1 expression (Figure 8).
--------
However, mammosphere cultures derived from BRCA1-silenced MCF7 or MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells (enriched in ALDH1 expression) were no longer sensitive to the growth inhibitory effects of vitamin D3.
--------
Effect of 1,25(OH)2D3 analogue, EB1089, on growth of BRCA1-silenced breast cancer cells

To further verify that BRCA1 is required for vitamin D3-mediated growth inhibition, we used SiGenome siRNA pool to transiently silence Brca1 in two murine isogenic mammary tumor cells, WT145 and KO240, that were previously described [32].

Importantly, somatic loss of both Brca1 and p53 resulted in the rapid and efficient formation of highly proliferative, poorly differentiated estrogen receptor-negative mammary tumors that closely mimic human BRCA-mutated breast cancers with basal-like phenotypes [64] suggesting that other genetic events contribute to tumorigenesis.

For example, early attempts to develop mouse models of BRCA1-linked breast cancer were unsuccessful (reviewed in [60]).

Previous studies have reported that BRCA1 expression is upregulated in BC tissues compared with that in benign breast tissues (33,34), which was also demonstrated in the present study.

In the final core signaling pathway, receptor PGR received microenvironment factor pS2 and transmitted the signal through transduction proteins GABARAPL2 and ARRDC3 to TF BRCA1 and NFE2L1 activating target gene CXCR4 to stimulate EMT and metastasis in non-TNBC.

For the next common core signaling pathway, the receptor ERBB2, which was mutated in breast cancer, received microenvironment factor CCL28 to activate TF BRCA1 through signaling transduction proteins CDC42 and ARRDC3 in TNBC and non-TNBC.

We report findings that further support the involvement of ovarian hormones in BRCA1-related tumor development and support the use of SPRM treatment for breast cancer prevention.

To evaluate the transcriptional activity of PR receptors in BRCA1 mutated tissues, we examined the expression level of fatty acid synthase (FASN), a PR-induced target gene that is associated with tumor growth of breast cancer cells.
--------
Proliferation and ovarian hormone signaling are impaired in normal breast tissues from women with BRCA1 mutations: benefit of a progesterone receptor modulator treatment as a breast cancer preventive strategy in women with inherited BRCA1 mutations

BRCA1 interactions with estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR) signaling were previously described in human breast cancer cell lines and mouse models.
--------
Although there was some variability from cell line to cell line, these studies show reproducible induction of BRCA1 and BRCA2 by I3C, with increases in BRCA1 and BRCA2 protein levels at an I3C dose of 60 μM at 24 h of (5–10)-fold for the breast cancer cell lines and (8–16)-fold for the prostate cancer cell lines.
--------
Previously, we showed that I3C induces BRCA1 expression and that both I3C and BRCA1 inhibit oestrogen (E2)-stimulated oestrogen receptor (ER-α) activity in human breast cancer cells.
--------
We showed that two phytochemicals with potential cancer prevention activity, I3C and genistein, each upregulate expression of the BRCA1 and BRCA2 breast cancer genes.
--------
The induction of BRCA1 was associated with morphologic evidence of mammary differentiation and a reduced susceptibility to 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene-induced mammary tumours.
--------
Genistein caused dose- and time-dependent increases in BRCA1 and BRCA2 protein levels in two oestrogen-responsive breast cancer cell lines (MCF-7 and T47D) (Figure 3D).
--------
As for breast cancer cells, BRCA1 and BRCA2 levels were increased by ⩾2-fold at the lowest dose of I3C (20 μM) (Figure 2G and H).
--------
Using rigorously controlled semiquantitative RT–PCR and densitometry analysis, we found that a dose of I3C (60 μM) that causes little or no cytotoxicity caused a time-dependent increase in BRCA1 and BRCA2 mRNA levels in two breast cancer cell lines, MCF-7 and T47D (Figure 1A and B).
--------
Previously, we showed that I3C induces BRCA1 expression and that both I3C and BRCA1 inhibit oestrogen (E2)-stimulated oestrogen receptor (ER-α) activity in human breast cancer cells.

--------
We showed some activities of I3C and genistein are blocked or partially reversed by inhibition of BRCA1: (1) upregulation of BRCA2 by I3C or genistein; (2) cytotoxicity due to high doses of I3C; (3) inhibition of E2-stimulated ER-α activity by I3C and/or genistein in breast cancer cells; and (4) inhibition of DHT-stimulated AR activity by I3C and genistein in prostate cancer cells.
--------
We previously showed that I3C stimulates BRCA1 expression in human cervical and breast cancer cells (Meng et al, 2000a, 2000b, 2001; Carter et al, 2002).
--------
By detecting the expression patterns of CREB1 downstream genes, we found that knockout of Cul5 enhanced the expression of CREB1 target genes, such as estrogen receptor 1 (ESR1), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), in Brca1-deficient and WT mammary cancer cells (Fig. 6, H and I).
--------
Meanwhile, Cul5 deficiency also promoted tumor development in Brca1-WT cells, although at a lower efficiency than in Brca1-MT cells, suggesting that CUL5 acts as a general tumor suppressor in breast cancer.
--------
Similarly, Cul5 knockout also partially suppressed the cellular lethality caused by acute knockdown of Brca1 (shBrca1) in the mouse mammary cancer cell line 4T1 (Fig. 2, C and D, and fig.
--------
Our results showed that knockout of Cul5 in Brca1-deficient mammary cancer cells also enhanced the CREB1 binding activity toward the CRE binding site by abolishing the CREB1 degradation process (Fig. 6K).
--------
Meanwhile, Cul5 deficiency also promoted tumor development in Brca1-WT cells, although at a lower efficiency than in Brca1-MT cells, suggesting that CUL5 acts as a general tumor suppressor in breast cancer.
--------
Loss of p53 has been reported to accelerate tumor formation in the Brca1 deficiency background (19), and CHK2 regulates DNA damage repair via p53 and BRCA1 and promotes tumor formation in breast cancer (20–22).
--------
Thus, our data reveal that CUL5 not only serves as a general tumor suppressor but also plays an important role for BRCA1-associated tumorigenesis, highlighting its important role for breast cancer research.

--------
To look more specifically at BRCA1-dependent regulation of the Notch receptors and ligands in the normal breast, we used two pseudo-normal breast cancer cell lines—HME-1 h-TERT immortalized cells and spontaneously immortalized 184A1 cells.
--------
siRNA-mediated knockdown of BRCA1 resulted in downregulated expression of Notch receptors and ligands [Figure 5C (ii)] consistent with our results from breast cancer cell lines and the ES cells.
--------
BRCA1 is a key regulator of breast differentiation through activation of Notch signalling with implications for anti-endocrine treatment of breast cancers
--------
When BRCA1 expression is abrogated specifically in the luminal progenitor subpopulation, mice develop mammary tumours that phenocopy human BRCA1 breast cancers (10).
--------
In this study, we show that BRCA1 activates the Notch pathway in both non-tumorigenic and breast cancer cells, in addition to primary breast tumours, through transcriptional upregulation of Notch receptors and ligands.
--------
When BRCA1 expression is abrogated specifically in the luminal progenitor subpopulation, mice develop mammary tumours that phenocopy human BRCA1 breast cancers (10).
--------
Together, these findings suggest that BRCA1 regulation of Notch signalling is important in the normal differentiation process in breast tissue, and that loss of this pathway may be a key event in the progression of basal-like breast cancers.
--------
When BRCA1 expression is abrogated specifically in the luminal progenitor subpopulation, mice develop mammary tumours that phenocopy human BRCA1 breast cancers (10).
--------
This pattern for loss of cell division axis control aligns with recent domain-specific breast cancer risk estimates for missense variants in BRCA1; there is an increased risk associated with protein-truncating variants and variants located in the regions encoding the RING domain and the BRCT1 domain3.
--------
Similar rescue experiments performed on primary human BRCA1-mutant LP- and BC-derived cells also showed elevated pPLK1 (T210) intensity at the spindle poles (Fig. 5h, Figure S10a) and treatment of these cells with 0.1 nM BI2536 likewise reduced their hyperactive PLK1 (Figure S10b) and normalized their cell division orientation (Fig. 5i).
--------
Further supporting this idea is the finding that genetic variations in HMMR27 modify breast cancer risk in BRCA1 mutation carriers and DYNLL1 expression correlates with survival in BRCA1-mutant patients that develop ovarian cancer28.
--------
One day post-irradiation, however, γH2Ax-foci were significantly elevated in the BRCA1-mutant LP progeny and reduced in the BRCA1-mutant BC progeny compared to their non-carrier counterparts (Fig. 1d).
--------
One day post-irradiation, however, γH2Ax-foci were significantly elevated in the BRCA1-mutant LP progeny and reduced in the BRCA1-mutant BC progeny compared to their non-carrier counterparts (Fig. 1d).
--------
LP or BC sources of non-carrier and BRCA1-mutant cells did not differ either in the basal levels of γH2Ax-positive foci, nor their levels measured 30 min post-irradiation (Fig. 1d).
--------
Here, we provide a direct mechanistic connection between BRCA1 function and oriented cell division in human mammary LPs and BCs.
--------
This showed the initial rate of entry into mitosis of the BRCA1-mutant LP- and BC-derived cells was significantly faster than that of their non-carrier counterparts (Fig. 2b, c, Figure S3a).
--------
To identify metastatic suppressors, we used Brca1-mutant (Brca1-MT) 545 cells, which were isolated from a primary mammary tumor of a Brca1-MSK mouse (8).
--------
Our recent studies on this strain of mice revealed that BRCA1 deficiency triggers alterations in multiple events, including mutations in potential tumor metastasis suppressors, an altered epithelial-mesenchymal transition, impaired mitophagy, and increased inflammasome activation, all of which may promote mammary tumor metastasis (11–13).
--------
In our efforts to identify drugs that might inhibit BRCA1-deficient tumor growth and metastasis, we found that paclitaxel or docetaxel treatment can reverse the expression pattern of ATP11B and PTDSS2 in breast cancers and significantly inhibit cancer metastasis.

Thus, Brca1 deficiency may result in the ATP11blo and Ptdss2hi phenotype that facilitates externalization of PS, which may account for the higher rate of metastasis of Brca1-MT mammary tumors.

Thus, Brca1 deficiency may result in the ATP11blo and Ptdss2hi phenotype that facilitates externalization of PS, which may account for the higher rate of metastasis of Brca1-MT mammary tumors.
--------
Our molecular analysis demonstrates that the expression signature of ATP11BloPTDSS2hi exposes PS on the outer leaflet of the cell membrane, which serves as a global immunosuppressive signal and synergizes with BRCA1 deficiency in breast cancer metastasis.
--------
A similar finding was observed in another Brca1-MT mammary tumor cell line, 628, which was derived from a Brca1-MSK mouse with multiorgan metastasis.
--------
To further define master genes that are critical for the regulation of immune genes in breast cancer patients with BRCA1 deficiency, we analyzed the GSE54219 data set with the GEOquery (https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/GEOquery.html) and RTN packages (https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/RTN.html) and found that ATP11B is one of the potent master genes related to PS function and could regulate immune gene expression in BRCA1 mutation carriers (Figure 7B and Supplemental Table 6).
--------
To recapitulate BRCA1 deficiency in breast cancer, tumors derived from the K14-Cre-Brca1f/f;Trp53f/f immunocompetent genetically engineered mouse model of TNBC were orthotopically implanted into the mammary fat pads of FVB/129P2 syngeneic mice.
--------
In addition to harboring mutations in BRCA1 or BRCA2, which is associated with increased POLQ expression (Supplementary Fig 1e, f)8,11, HR-deficient TNBC and PDAC are more likely to harbor mutations in TP53, which leads to even more pronounced expression of POLQ36,37.
--------
Genetic complementation between mouse Brca1 and Cobra1 in R-loop dynamics and mammary tumorigenesis strongly suggests that COBRA1 contributes to BRCA1-associated breast cancer development.
--------
To explore a functional link between promoter-proximal NELF-mediated Pol II pausing and BRCA1-associated R-loop accumulation, we knocked down (KD) BRCA1 and COBRA1 in T47D luminal breast cancer cells (Fig. 5a).
--------
Genetic complementation between mouse Brca1 and Cobra1 in R-loop dynamics and mammary tumorigenesis strongly suggests that COBRA1 contributes to BRCA1-associated breast cancer development.
--------
Using mouse genetic models, we further show that attenuation of Pol II pausing reduces incidence of Brca1-associated mouse mammary tumour incidence in a DNA repair-independent manner.
--------
In striking contrast, DKO mice with homozygous deletion of Cobra1 and Brca1 (blue) exhibited significantly lower mammary tumour incidence than BKO and BKO, C-hemi mice (Fig. 6c).
--------
To explore a functional link between promoter-proximal NELF-mediated Pol II pausing and BRCA1-associated R-loop accumulation, we knocked down (KD) BRCA1 and COBRA1 in T47D luminal breast cancer cells (Fig. 5a).
--------
Using a combined gene set consisting of both groups of genes, we found that promoter regions with BRCA1 mutation-associated R-loops are enriched with binding sites for breast cancer-related transcription factors, such as GATA3 and FOXA1 in LP cells and SMAD2/4 and STAT6 in ML cells (Fig. 3c).
--------
Our studies show that Pol II pausing is an important contributor to BRCA1-associated R-loop accumulation and breast cancer development.
--------
The vast majority of BRCA1-driven breast cancers derive from luminal progenitor cells but the mechanisms of this lineage specificity are unclear.
--------
Thus, genetic ablation of Cobra1 ameliorates Brca1-associated R-loop accumulation and mammary tumour development, but it does not appear to affect progression of Brca1-associated tumours once they are formed.
--------
This review aimed to provide significant insights into up-to-date knowledge about the role of BRCA1/2-mutated tumor microenvironment and possible mechanisms by which it interacts with and promotes breast cancer development and progression.

We observed an increased expression of Ubc9 in BRCA1 mutant TNBC cells while knockdown of Ubc9 expression in these cells decreased their proliferation and migration [27].

Using patient-derived cell lines with known BRCA1 mutations, we reported the in-vivo association of BRCA1 and Ubc9 in normal mammary epithelial cells, but not in BRCA1 mutant TNBC cells.

Our work is based on the hypothesis that loss of BRCA1 in women with high breast density causes abnormal Ubc9 levels which upregulates collagen, fibronectin and inhibits SIRT1, β-catenin expression facilitating TNBC.

We show that reducing Sox11 levels in the Brca1-deficient mammary tumour (Brca1.3) has similar effects on proliferation, stem cell activity and expression of lineage markers to those observed in studies using embryonic mammary progenitor cells (eG2M5).

To elucidate the physiological role of CTSS in mammary tumorigenesis, we examined the relationship between CTSS and BRCA1 expression in spontaneously induced rat mammary tumors.
--------
When a human breast cancer tissue slide that included 70 patient specimens were examined, BRCA1 and CTSS expression were evident in the breast tissues, and total expression levels of each protein did not show an inverse correlation, in contrast to the rat mammary tumors.
--------
To determine these relationships in human breast cancers, we used human breast cancer tissue arrays and found inverse correlation of expression patterns of CTSS and BRCA1 within each slide, suggesting possibly targeting CTSS to BRCA1 even in human breast cancer tissues.

These results indicate that curcumin promotes cytoplasmic retention of BRCA1 in triple negative breast cancer cells that have functional BRCA1.
--------
Since BRCA1 dysfunction is linked to TNBC, and since our results show apoptotic effects of curcumin in TNBC, a potential role for dietary compounds in prevention or complimentary treatment of TNBC warrants further study.
--------
Cytoplasmic retention of DNA repair protein BRCA1 suggests that TNBC cells MDA468 and HCC1806 may be unable to repair curcumin-mediated DNA damage and may undergo apoptosis in response to curcumin exposure.

--------
DNA damage and cytoplasmic retention of BRCA1 post-curcumin treatment are associated with apoptosis of TNBC cells.
--------
Since most sporadic TNBCs have down-regulated wild-type brca1, similar to HCC1806 cells, a majority of TNBCs may benefit from curcumin-based treatment strategies.
--------
In summary, we report here that curcumin induces DNA damage and modulates BRCA1 protein expression, phosphorylation, and cellular localization in triple negative breast cancer cells with wild-type brca1, but not in a cell line with mutant brca1, nor in non-transformed mammary epithelial cells.
--------
Phosphorylation of ATM/chk2-specific sites on BRCA1 suggests that curcumin may be inducing DNA damage in TNBC cells.
--------
Previously (38–40), we reported that the expression of BRCA1 was stimulated by E2 in ER-positive MCF7 breast cancer cells (38).
--------
Taken together, the data of the present study provide novel in vitro and mammary tumor xenograft evidence that exposure to inorganic trivalent arsenic, such as NaAsIII may increase resistance to endocrine therapy based on TAM through reduction in BRCA1 and ERα expression.
--------
Based on these observations, the main objective of this study was to investigate the effects of AsIII on BRCA1 and ESR1 (ERα) expression and CpG methylation, and response to TAM in cultured and xenografted MCF7 breast cancer cells.
--------
These cumulative observations suggest arsenic exposure may interfere with endocrine regulation and prompted our investigation into whether or not AsIII contributes to resistance to TAM therapy through the silencing of BRCA1 and ESR1. In this study, we first examined the in vitro effects of NaAsIII in ERα-positive breast cancer cells and found that acute (within 4 days) and long-term (10 days to 7 weeks) exposure to environmentally relevant doses of AsIII reduced BRCA1 expression.
--------
However, AG14361 treatment exhibited only mild specificity in mouse BRCA1-/- mammary cancer cells (Fig. 3B) in comparison with their controls (Fig. 3C) in the xenografted nude mice.
--------
However, it is noticed that these data were obtained by using non-cancerous and genetically naïve BRCA1/2-/- ES cells, BRCA2-/- V-C8 hamster cells, and two BRCA2-proficient breast cancer cell lines, MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231, that carried acute suppression of BRCA2 by siRNA.
--------
One of the notable findings in this study is that Fgfr2 suppresses expression of BRCA1, which is a well‐known breast cancer suppressor gene in humans and mice.[25, 39, 40] About one‐third of all sporadic breast cancers have low BRCA1 levels even though they are WT for BRCA1.[41] Thus, BRCA1 may undergo transcriptional regulation.
--------
We generated isogenic cancer pairs by using lentiviral vectors encoding two individual short‐hairpin RNAs (shRNA) against Brca1 to transduce a cell line derived from a Fgfr2‐S252W mammary tumor (Figure7A,B).
--------
In contrast, the Fgfr2‐S252W and Brca1‐MKO mice manifested mammary tumors at median times of 15 and 21 months, respectively (Figure 5C).

At about 6 months, the Fgfr2‐S252W;Brca1‐MKO mice began to develop mammary tumors.

To clarify the molecular mechanism by which FGFR2‐S252W regulates BRCA1, we transfected FGFR2‐S252W into five different breast cancer cell lines.

Given that both ER− and ER+ BRCA1 breast cancers seem to originate from a common luminal progenitor cell population, it has been suggested that ER status of breast cancer occurring in BRCA1 mutation carriers may be under control of different molecular mechanisms [29].

Here, we provide a review of the emerging preclinical and epidemiologic evidence implicating the dysregulation of progesterone-mediated receptor activator of nuclear factor κB (RANK) signaling in the pathogenesis of BRCA1-associated breast cancer.

In summary, there is strong evidence indicating the essential role of progesterone-mediated RANK signaling in the expansion of a population of RANK+ luminal progenitors which are the likely cells of origin for BRCA1-associated basal-like breast cancers [28].
--------
Here we have presented a brief overview of the experimental and epidemiologic evidence suggesting that dysregulation of the progesterone-mediated RANK signaling pathway plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of BRCA1-associated breast cancer.
--------
When recombinant OPG (OPG-Fc), a RANKL inhibitor like denosumab, was used for inhibition of RANKL in mice with a Brca1 mutation, the authors also observed reduced mammary tumor growth [23].
--------
Furthermore, the preclinical and experimental data support therapeutic inhibition of the RANK pathway for the primary prevention of BRCA1-associated breast cancer [23, 24].
--------
Emerging role of the RANK signaling pathway in the pathogenesis of BRCA1-associated breast cancer
--------
Collectively, the evidence supports therapeutic inhibition of the RANK pathway for the primary prevention of BRCA1-associated breast cancer, which may generate unique prevention strategies (without prophylactic surgery) and enhance quality of life.
--------
Nonetheless, OPG is a promising biomarker for BRCA1-associated breast cancer risk due to the association between BRCA1 mutation and OPG levels [30].
--------
Furthermore, we (and others) have hypothesized that quantification of circulating osteoprotegerin (OPG), the decoy receptor of RANK-ligand (RANKL), may serve as a potential biomarker of BRCA1-associated breast cancer risk that may not only improve upon current risk prediction models, stratifying women at the highest risk of developing the disease, but may further identify those who may be targets for anti-RANKL chemoprevention.
--------
Preclinical evidence suggests that GR antiproliferative effects are mediated by BRCA1, where BRCA1 activity leads to downstream phosphorylation of the MAPK p38, which, in turn, phosphorylates GR to GR-active and GC independent form (P-Ser211).124 However, some studies suggest that GR long-term activity decreases BRCA1 expression while free GR increase BRCA1 expression.127,128 More evidence is required for the specifics of this mechanism, but GR and P-Ser211 may be useful proteomic PD biomarkers in TNBC therapy.

In this context we believe that Brca1Co/Co;p53+/-;MMTV-Cre mice should serve as a powerful tool to dissect the role of BRCA1 in the cancer initiating cells and provide insights into development and treatment of breast cancer specifically in BRCA1 mutation carriers.

We have also isolated a discrete subpopulation of CD24+CD29+ cells from BRCA1 mutant primary mammary tumors after using antibodies against well-characterized endothelial (CD31) and hematopoietic (CD45 and TER119) antigens to deplete these lineage positive cells followed by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) (Fig. 1D).

We demonstrate here that mutation of the PP1-binding motif compromises BRCA1 activities in enhancing error-free HR and to a lesser extent suppressing error-prone NHEJ assayed in Brca1-deficient mouse mammary tumor cells, which is consisitent with our previous finding that PP1α regulates S988 phsophorylation 18.
--------
In this study, we show that mutant BRCA1 proteins lacking a functional PP1-binding motif are defective in enhancing survival of Brca1-deficient mouse mammary tumor cells after DNA damage at least in part due to an impaired DNA repair function as demonstrated by the Rad51 focus formation and comet assays.

We previously demonstrated that transient expression of wild-type but not PP1-binding motif mutated (F901A) or deleted (DEL) human BRCA1GFP protein increased cell survival after DNA damage in a BRCA1-deficient breast cancer cell line HCC1937 19.
--------
Here we show that mutation of the PP1-binding motif abolishes the ability of BRCA1 to enhance survival of Brca1-deficient mouse mammary tumor cells after DNA damage.
--------
Because the coding sequences for the PP1-binding motif 898KVTF901 is located in exon 11, we sought to confirm this finding in a Brca1 exon 11-deleted (Brca1∆11/∆11) mouse mammary tumor cell line 780 31 and study the underlying mechanisms.

In the present study, our data clearly demonstrate that expression of ICN1, representing Notch1 activation, promotes Brca1-associated mammary tumour formation.

These data indicate that SB-mediated insertional mutagenesis in Brca1 mammary gland-specific knockout mice accelerates mammary tumour formation without changing the total tumour spectrum.

In 54 BRCA1-deficient breast cancers in this cohort, increased expression of NOTCH1 also correlated with TNBC and the basal-type.
--------
Using mouse models, we and others have demonstrated that complete knockout of Brca1 in the whole body (Brca1−/−) causes lethality at embryonic day 7–8 (E7-8)12,13; in contrast, mammary-specific deletion of exon 11 of Brca1 (Brca1Co/Co;MMTV-Cre) results in mammary tumour formation accompanied by massive genomic alterations and cellular lethality14.

Moreover, under BRCA1-defective conditions, NOTCH1 tended to display an enhanced ability to promote TNBC and basal-type breast cancer (Supplementary Fig. 8c, d).

To refine these findings and to explore the biological significance of features thought to result from alterations of cell-to-cell adhesion systems, rare in sporadic cases but more frequent in BRCA1-associated breast cancers (BRCA1-BCs), we investigated E-cadherin expression by immuno-histochemistry in a combined panel of 214 breast cancers enriched in hereditary cases (176 sporadic cases and 38 BRCA1-BCs).

As shown in Figure 5A, EZH2 down-regulation increased the protein levels of total BRCA1 and BRCA1 phosphorylated at serine 1423 (pBRCA1 s1423) in the nuclei of MDA-MB-231 and CAL51 breast cancer cells.
--------
We provide the first link between EZH2 and BRCA1 proteins and show that EZH2 knockdown depends on BRCA1 up-regulation to decrease breast cancer proliferation and progression through G2 phase (Figure 7B).
--------
To ascertain the role of BRCA1 in EZH2 mediated cell proliferation, we subjected these breast cancer cells to proliferation assays and flow cytometry.
--------
The relevance of the association between EZH2 and BRCA1 proteins to human breast cancer is highlighted by the finding that 76 % of ER negative invasive carcinomas overexpress EZH2 and are negative for pBRCA1 s1423 protein.
--------
Our experiments show that EZH2 knockdown is sufficient to increase BRCA1 levels in breast cancer cells and trigger similar effects in G2/M as those reported after ectopic expression of BRCA1 using an adenovirus vector in the absence of ionizing irradiation (MacLachlan et al., 2000; Yan et al., 2005).
--------
We next tested the hypothesis that EZH2 may promote breast tumorigenesis by regulating BRCA1 in this subtype of breast cancer.
--------
The in vivo relevance of these findings is underscored by our xenograft mouse models showing that EZH2 knockdown increased BRCA1 and pBRCA1 s1423 proteins in the nuclei of breast cancer cells in situ.
--------
As shown in Figure 5A, EZH2 down-regulation increased the protein levels of total BRCA1 and BRCA1 phosphorylated at serine 1423 (pBRCA1 s1423) in the nuclei of MDA-MB-231 and CAL51 breast cancer cells.

We provide the first link between EZH2 and BRCA1 proteins and show that EZH2 knockdown depends on BRCA1 up-regulation to decrease breast cancer proliferation and progression through G2 phase (Figure 7B).
--------
Ectopic overexpression of BRCA1 in breast cancer cells has been shown to cause G2/M arrest by regulating the levels and activity of Cdc2/Cyclin B1 complex and the dual phosphatase Cdc25C, both of which are essential for G2/M checkpoint control (MacLachlan et al., 2000; Yan et al., 2005).
--------
In our present study, the effects of genistein on proliferation and progression of BRCA1 mutated TNBC cells were investigated.
--------
Again, BRCA1 impaired TNBC cells were more responsive to genistein compared to those with functionally active BRCA1.
--------
ER-negative breast cancer patients often have a mutation in the tumor suppressor gene, BRCA1. This study explored antiproliferative effects of genistein, a chemopreventive isoflavone present in legumes, and underlying molecular mechanisms in triple negative breast cancer cells with or without functionally active BRCA1.

6. Effects of BRCA1 silencing on growth of triple negative breast cancer cells in athymic nude mice
--------
Germline mutation of Brca1 alters the fate of mammary luminal cells and causes luminal-to-basal mammary tumor transformation.
--------
We report here that germline mutation of Brca1 in p18-deficient mice blocks the increase of luminal progenitor cells, impairs luminal gene expression and promotes malignant transformation of mammary tumors.
--------
These results also suggest a novel mechanism--causing luminal-to-basal transformation--for the development of basal-like breast cancer in familial BRCA1 carriers and establish a unique mouse model for developing therapeutic strategies to target both luminal and basal-like breast cancers.
--------
Instead of the luminal mammary tumors developed in p18 single-mutant mice, mammary tumors developed in the p18;Brca1 mice, similar to breast cancer developed in familial BRCA1 carriers, exhibited extensive basal-like features and lost the remaining wild-type allele of Brca1.

These results reveal distinct functions of the RB and BRCA1 pathways in suppressing luminal and basal-like mammary tumors, respectively.

--------
The mechanism underlying the function of BRCA1 in suppressing basal-like breast cancer remains unclear.
--------
However, while homozygous MMTV-BRCA1 mice (lines 5 and 6) showed delayed onset against DMBA-induced mammary tumors, expression of BRCA1sv (lines 90 and 61) greatly worsened the outcome of these mice for mammary cancer.
--------
Unlike the BRCA1sv mice, the outcome of DMBA-induced mammary tumors in BRCA1 t340 homozygous transgenic lines was not affected (Fig. 7A).
--------
However, while homozygous MMTV-BRCA1 mice (lines 5 and 6) showed delayed onset against DMBA-induced mammary tumors, expression of BRCA1sv (lines 90 and 61) greatly worsened the outcome of these mice for mammary cancer.
--------
Our current observations on the effects of BRCA1 on both epithelial cell proliferation and mammary tumor formation stand in contrast to a previous report of effects of this splice variant in cultured tumor cells 22, in which an anti-proliferative effect of RING-deleted BRCA1 was observed.
--------
Interestingly, epigenetic intervention, using the HMT immediately before IR, not only increased the cytosolic localization of BRCA1 but also suppressed DNA-damage-induced focus formation of BRCA1 in BC cells (Figures 3b and c).
--------
Although inhibition of H4K20 and H3K79 dimethylation clearly explains the decrease observed in IR damage-induced focus formation in 53BP1,4, 5 the effect of hypomethylating conditions on the localization of BRCA1 in BC cells after IR was less clear.
--------
Interestingly, epigenetic intervention, using the HMT immediately before IR, not only increased the cytosolic localization of BRCA1 but also suppressed DNA-damage-induced focus formation of BRCA1 in BC cells (Figures 3b and c).
--------
The treatment impeded the recruitment of 53BP1 and BRCA1 to the chromatin regions flanking DNA double-strand breaks and thereby avoided the DNA damage responses in breast cancer cells that were exposed to ionizing radiation.
--------
Are Trp53 rescue of Brca1 embryonic lethality and Trp53/Brca1 breast cancer association related?
--------
In contrast, mice with this Brca1 mutation on a wild-type Trp53 background did not develop mammary tumors.
--------
Multiple studies have now suggested that Trp53 loss accelerates mammary tumor formation when associated with Brca1 mutations.
--------
Are Trp53 rescue of Brca1 embryonic lethality and Trp53/Brca1 breast cancer association related?
--------
Trp53 hemizygosity allowed mice with the Brca1 mutation developed by Cressman et al. [11] to develop a few mammary tumors after exposure to ionizing radiation, although these results did not achieve statistical significance.
--------
However, the precise mechanisms through which Brca1 interacts with Trp53 to suppress mammary tumor formation have yet to be elucidated.
--------
Ludwig et al.[13] found that many of their homozygous Brca1-mutant mice also developed mammary tumors as well as a wide variety of other tumors.
--------
Finally, there was a decreased latency and increased incidence of mammary tumor formation in conditionally mutant Brca1 mice that had a Trp53 mutation [12,20].
--------
What is the relationship between BRCA1 and Trp53 mutations that leads specifically to mammary tumor development?
--------
(A) Schematic of workflow for the isolation of mammary tumor cells from BRCA1-null, PyMT and Neu tumors for scRNA-seq.

In this study, we analyzed the single-cell transcriptomes of 11639 mammary tumor cells from three prominent mouse models of breast cancer (BRCA1-null, PyMT, Neu).
--------
(B) t-SNE plots of mammary tumor cells colored by tumor sample; Neu (blue), PyMT (green), BRCA1-null (red).
--------
Complementarily, Brca1F/F Trp53F/F Krt14-Cre mice develop mammary tumors (Liu et al., 2007) (designated as BRCA1-null tumors) which mimic basal-like breast cancers and were ER-/PR-/HER- (Figure 1—figure supplement 1A).
--------
Through single-cell RNA-sequencing, we found that Neu, PyMT and BRCA1-null mammary tumors each corresponded to a spectrum of minimally overlapping cell differentiation states without a universal BCSC population.
--------
To examine the potential effect of the 21 prioritized BRCA1 and BRCA2 5′ noncoding variants on regulatory activity, promoter activity was measured using luciferase assays in MCF7 and MDA‐MB‐468 BC cell lines.

Thus, we interbred mice expressing the CRE-recombinase with mice harboring loxP sites at TP53 and BRCA1 (K14-Cre; p53f/f Brca1f/f) to test the hypothesis that tissue-specific deletion of TP53 and BRCA1 would give rise to tumors reflective of human basal-like breast cancer.
--------
Given that BRCA1 and TP53 loss is a common occurrence in basal-like breast cancer, we hypothesized that the deletion of these genes in the mammary epithelium would give rise to tumors with basal-like features.

Interestingly, the increased BRCA-1 promoter methylation in TNBC correlated with increased expression (~3.0-fold of control) of AhR. Overall, these results denoted that coordinated increase in AhR expression and BRCA-1 gene hypermethylation may be molecular markers of TNBC.

These observations provided additional support to the hypothesis that constitutive AhR expression may be associated with hypermethylation of the BRCA-1 promoter and the development of TNBC.

Our work outlined a useful strategy for determining the peptide-petidase relationship and thus establishing a biological mechanism for changes in the peptidome in BRCA1-associated BC.

Increased KLK2 activity, with decreased CPN1 activity, results in the accumulation of KNG1K438-R457 in BRCA1-associated BC.

The peptides, KNG1K438-R457 and C 3fS1304-R1320, were identified as putative peptide candidates to differentiate BRCA1 mutant BC from sporadic BC and cancer-free BRCA1 mutant carriers.

The aim of this study was to identify and characterize circulating peptides that correlate with BC patients carrying BRCA1 mutations.

--------
With regard to the effect on BRCA1 expression, we recently showed that IROSE ERα function in ERα/BRCA1-expressing breast cancer cells (e.g., MCF7) [40].
--------
BRCA1 also interacts with GADD45A (growth arrest and DNA damage-inducible protein GADD45 alpha) that may target NER machinery to actively demethylate genome sites in order to change the expression of genes that may be important in breast cancer.
--------
BRCT and RING are implicated in the interaction between BRCA1 and other proteins and their mutations are found in breast cancer [15,16].
--------
When BRCA1 induces GADD45A in breast cancer, it may lead to apoptosis through the JNK pathway and interaction with MTK1/MEKK4 [113].
--------
Therefore, the interaction between BRCA1 and GADD45 may play a role in breast cancer pathogenesis through the stimulation of NER, increasing the genomic stability, removing carcinogenic adducts, and the local active demethylation of genes important for cancer transformation.

To further investigate the role of BRCA we determined LOH of BRCA1 and correlated this with LOH in other breast cancer-associated regions.<h4>Materials and methods</h4>A total of 105 sporadic breast carcinomas were analysed for LOH in the regions of BRCA1, BRCA2, TP53, Caveolin1, "putative BRCA3", PTEN, ATM and E-cadherin and correlated it with clinicopathological features.<h4>Results</h4>We found an overall increase of LOH in carcinomas with simultaneous LOH of BRCA1.

Quantification of colony formation revealed that combined GSK126/AZD1390 treatment caused a 78% decrease in colony-forming units in BRCA1-mutant SUM149 cells compared to vehicle control (SUM149: p < 0.015), a 69% decrease compared to single GSK126 treatment (SUM149: p = 0.004), and a 57% decrease compared to single AZD1390 treatment (SUM149: p = 0.012), but not in BRCA1-wild type CAL120 cells, corroborating a robust synergistic effect also in human BRCA1-mutant TNBC cells (Fig. 4B).

Again, assessment of clonogenic survival revealed a significant decrease in the number of colonies by combined GSK126/AZD1390 treatment in BRCA1-mutant TNBC cells, compared to vehicle control, as well as to single GSK126 or AZD1390 treatment (Fig. 4B).

To investigate the cytotoxic effect of combined EZH2 and ATM inhibition in human BRCA1-mutant breast cancer, we treated the human TNBC cell lines SUM149 (BRCA1-mutant) and CAL120 (BRCA1-wild type) with GSK126 and AZD1390, and analyzed cell viability using CellTiter-Glo and clonogenic survival (Fig. 4A, B).

In particular, the P53 gene has been shown to be a specific prognostic factor in TNBC.50 In addition, the DNA damage signaling kinase ATM has been shown to be aberrantly reduced or lost in BRCA1/BRCA2-deficient breast cancer and TNBC.46 Overall, the pathway prediction and network modeling confirmed our hypothesis that genes containing SNPs interact with each other and other genes not identified by GWAS in biological pathways.
--------
TNBC likely originates from luminal ER− progenitors, and the gene expression profile of both BRCA1 mutation-associated and sporadic TNBC reflects a luminal progenitor-like profile (Lim et al., 2009, Molyneux et al., 2010).
--------
c-KIT+/ER− mammary luminal progenitors are considered the cell of origin of BRCA1-mutated and sporadic TNBC (Lim et al., 2009, Molyneux et al., 2010).
--------
LYN activity is modulated by PIN1, a prolyl isomerase, and in BRCA1 mutant TNBC PIN1 upregulation activates LYN independently of c-KIT.
--------
In BRCA1-deficient TNBC, loss of this transcriptional repression results in increased PIN1 levels and thus in LYN activation independently of c-KIT.
--------
To elucidate the relationship of LYN phosphorylation, PIN1, and BRCA1, we silenced PIN1 in a broader panel of TNBC cell lines.

To investigate the contribution of BRCA1 to breast cancer, mice with cre-mediated deletion of Brca1 in mammary epithelial cells (Brca1co/coMMTV-cre mice) were developed and displayed the mammary tumor formation after a long latency [10].

Taken together, these findings suggest that BRCA1-associated lacrimal gland tumors share molecular characteristics with BRCA1-deficient breast cancer and that structural proteins exhibit the alteration in level and distributions depend on the progression of cancer.

For the studies of BRCA1-associated breast cancer, we generated the female Brca1 conditional knockout mice with MMTV-cre-mediated recombination (Brca1co/coMMTV-cre).
--------
We uncovered that BRCA1 binds to the GATA3 binding sites in the promoter of PDGFRβ to repress its transcription and that depletion of Brca1 stimulates the expression of PDGFRβ activating the PDGFRβ-PKCα-FRA1 pathway to induce EMT and drive CSC function in breast cancer [38].
--------
These data suggest that Gata3 functions downstream of Brca1 to promote c-Fos and suppress Fra1 expression in inhibition of EMT and mammary tumor initiation.
--------
Inspired by our finding that GATA3 functions downstream of BRCA1 to suppress EMT in breast cancer [15] and that BRCA1 deficiency stimulates the expression of FRA1 in mammary tumors [38, 39], we hypothesized that reconstitution of GATA3 in BRCA1 deficient tumor cells also restores the expression of AP-1, thus inhibiting tumorigenesis.
--------
Consistently, reconstitution of Gata3 in Gata3- or Brca1-deficient human and mouse mammary tumor cells restores the expression of c-Fos and suppresses Fra1 in inhibiting EMT, motility, invasion, and tumorigenesis.

Key IFN-γ-induced genes upregulated at baseline in BRCA1-null vs. BRCA1+OC and BC cells included CXCL10, CXCL11, and IFI16. Increased localization of STAT1 in the promoters of these genes occurred in BRCA1-null OC cells, resulting in diminished responses to IFN-γ or to STAT1 knockdown.
--------
Interestingly, differential apoptotic response to IFN-γ dependent on the presence of functional BRCA1 was previously observed in the HCC1937 isogenic breast cancer model,38 although the mechanism responsible for this phenomenon was not elucidated.

To exclude the possibility that these observations were cell model dependent, we tested the response to IFN in isogenic BRCA1 mutated breast cancer cells (HCC1937) and cells stably transfected with BRCA1 (HCC1937+ BRCA1).

Because the BRCA1-depleted MCF7 cells used in this study mimic the physiological status of BRCA1 in breast cancers, we asked whether some translationally deregulated mRNAs encode potential therapeutic targets.

By comparing protein expression levels with RNA levels, a recent proteomic study using mouse Brca1-deficient mammary tumours clearly showed that RNA levels can be discordant with their protein expression [23].
--------
A proteomic study using mouse Brca1-deficient mammary tumours has recently reported TOP1 as up-regulated [23] therefore strengthening our findings.
--------
We have also tested two Brca1-deficient mouse cell lines, 780 and 69, and two Brca1 wild-type cell lines, NK and Ras, which were derived from mammary tumors of MMTV-Neu and MMTV-Ras, respectively [40,41].

--------
In addition to T1 and T7, we found three other spontaneous tumors (named here T9, T10 and T11) with more than 10% ABCG2-positive tumors cells in our panel of 28 Brca1−/−;p53−/− mammary tumors derived from FVB/N mice (Zander et al., submitted for publication).
--------
EZN-2208 (PEG-SN38) Overcomes ABCG2-Mediated Topotecan Resistance in BRCA1-Deficient Mouse Mammary Tumors
--------
In our model, we found that EZN-2208 results in durable responses of ABCG2-expressing BRCA1-deficient mammary tumors, in contrast to topotecan or irinotecan treatment.
--------
We have previously studied topotecan responses in a genetically engineered mouse model for BRCA1-deficient breast cancer [5].
--------
Using our conditional K14cre;Brca1F/F;p53F/F mouse model, we showed previously that BRCA1;p53-deficient mammary tumors initially respond to topotecan, but frequently acquire resistance by overexpression of the efflux transporter ABCG2.
--------
Using a genetically engineered mouse model for BRCA1-deficient breast cancer, we investigated therapeutic strategies to overcome ABCG2-mediated resistance to clinically used topoisomerase I inhibitors.
--------
We have shown that the spontaneous mammary tumors of our BRCA1 model can be transplanted orthotopically into syngeneic mice without loss of their genomic profile, morphology, or sensitivity to drug [5], [20], [21].
--------
Given this limited success of the ABCG2 inhibitor Ko143, we tested EZN-2208, a pegylated form of the active irinotecan metabolite SN38 [28], to treat ABCG2-positive Brca1−/−;p53−/− mammary tumors.
--------
While human BRCA1-mutated tumors can develop resistance to carboplatin by genetic reversion of the BRCA1 mutation48 – stressing the importance of BRCA1 function for HR – mouse mammary tumor models with large deletions in Brca1 cannot employ this mechanism and remain sensitive to cisplatin or carboplatin, even after multiple rounds of treatment47.
--------
Furthermore, aberrant expression of 53BP1 is more common in BRCA1/2 associated breast cancers, which may hint at a role for 53BP1 loss in these tumors.
--------
53BP1 loss rescues BRCA1 deficiency and is associated with triple-negative and BRCA-mutated breast cancers

--------
In contrast, Brca1Δ11/Δ11 mouse mammary tumors, which only express the BRCA1-Δ11 isoform, readily become resistant to cisplatin despite the fact that Brca1 exon 11 sequences are irreversibly deleted49.

--------
The protective effect against BC observed in BRCA1 carriers after ovariectomy may stem from the removal of paracrine signals from differentiated ER/PR-positive luminal cells directed towards primitive stem/progenitor cells [21].
--------
It is intriguing that breast cancers (BC) in BRCA1 mutation carriers predominantly originate from cells of the luminal lineage.
--------
(12) Mechanistically, the RANK-RANKL pathway, pivotal for mediating paracrine actions in luminal homeostasis, shows atypical activation in BRCA1 mutation carriers even before evident clinical manifestations of BC.
--------
MicroRNA networks linked with BRCA1/2, PTEN, and common genes for Alzheimer's disease and breast cancer share highly enriched pathways that may unravel targets for the AD/BC comorbidity treatment.
--------
MicroRNA networks linked with BRCA1/2, PTEN, and common genes for Alzheimer's disease and breast cancer share highly enriched pathways that may unravel targets for the AD/BC comorbidity treatment.
--------
In this study, we have performed a molecular profiling of plasma proteome from individuals (BC-affected and non-affected carriers) bearing a BRCA1 germline mutation in their genome.
--------
In this study, we investigated the interplay between WWOX and BRCA1, both frequently inactivated in TNBC, on mammary tumor development and on DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair choice.
--------
We generated and characterized a transgenic mouse model (K14-Cre;Brca1fl/fl;Wwoxfl/fl) and observed that mice lacking both WWOX and BRCA1 developed basal-like mammary tumors and exhibited a decrease in 53BP1 foci and an increase in RAD51 foci, suggesting impaired DSB repair.
--------
Combined targeted loss of Wwox and Brca1 in K14+ cells result in basal-like mammary tumors in vivo
--------
Given the effect of combined deletion of Wwox and Brca1 on mammary tumor formation and the known effect of WWOX/BRCA1 interaction on DNA repair pathway choice in vitro [17, 38, 39], we next set to examine which DSB repair pathway is favored in tumors of K14-Cre;Brca1fl/fl;Wwoxfl/fl mice.
--------
In summary, our study revealed that WWOX and BRCA1 loss led to the development of basal-like mammary tumors and impaired DSB repair.
--------
Deletion of one p53 allele further accelerates tumor formation mediated by loss of Wwox and Brca1, further demonstrating the significance of this triad in breast cancer development.
--------
Our findings here show for the first time that in K14-Cre conditional murine model, combined deletion of Wwox and Brca1 synergizes to accelerate mammary tumor formation in vivo.
--------
Additionally, as in human BRCA1-associated breast cancer, increased expression of several components of the IGF axis is seen in liver, normal mammary tissue and mammary tumors of these mice along with increased levels of IGF-1 in serum [13].
--------
In order to gain insights into the downstream factors involved in human BRCA1-associated breast cancers, a mouse model was developed with a conditional Brca1 gene deletion [10].
--------
Additionally, as in human BRCA1-associated breast cancer, increased expression of several components of the IGF axis is seen in liver, normal mammary tissue and mammary tumors of these mice along with increased levels of IGF-1 in serum [13].
--------
Because of the need for fast and inexpensive diagnostic tools to detect risk factors associated with breast cancers and other malignancies, we investigated the possibility of using a carbon nanotube field-effect transistor (CNT-FET) to measure serum IGF-1 levels in the Brca1-associated mouse model of human breast cancer.
--------
The frequency of mammary tumors based on the mutational state of Brca1 and p53 and on the nature of the transgenic construct utilized is shown in Table 1.
--------
Mice carrying a mutation in p53 but not in Brca1 also developed mammary tumors, raising questions about the contribution of the Brca1 mutation to cancer development in our double mutant animals.
--------
DNA was extracted from mammary tumors of 3 different mice heterozygous for the floxed Brca1 allele as well as from the tail of the same animals.
--------
These results indicate that the ternary complex specifically supports growth of BRCA1-deficient mammary tumors partly by facilitating DNA repair.
--------
Furthermore, the substitution reduced proliferation of BRCA1−/−p53−/− mouse mammary tumor KB1P-G3 and KB1P-B11 cells55 to the same level as HSF1 knockdown (Fig. 7b and Supplementary Fig. 8e).
--------
In contrast, this substitution moderately reduced proliferation of human mammary tumor HCC1937 and MDA-MB-436 cells, which carry BRCA1 mutations54.
--------
We showed that impaired complex formation as well as HSF1 deficiency reduces proliferation of human mammary tumor cells carrying BRCA1 mutations54 and BRCA1-null mammary tumor cells55, and enhances DNA damage in normal growth conditions (Fig. 7).

Specific examples include association of the CHEK2 c.1100delC variant with ER-positive disease [16, 17], and BRCA1, BRCA2, BARD1, BRIP1, PALB2, RAD51C, RAD51D, and TP53 variants with increased risks of triple-negative breast cancer (i.e., tumors that are negative for estrogen receptor [ER], for progesterone receptor [PR], and for amplification of the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2/erythroblastic oncogene B [HER2/ERBB2] gene, TNBC) [18–20].

--------
Although the Brca1/Trp53-deficient breast tumor models are important in that they recapitulate features of human breast cancer (39, 40, 45–52), they are inefficient for testing drug responses due to long tumor latency (>6–12 months).
--------
In patients with inherited TP53 mutations and mouse models of cancer with heterozygous germline Trp53 deficiency such as Brca1-deficient breast cancer models, the remaining WT allele is lost during tumorigenesis (23, 36–40).
--------
Similar to improved in vivo drug screening, assessing BRCA1 variants in the murine mammary tumor system is a laborious task, and our hematopoietic Brca1/Trp53 leukemia model could provide an alternative model.
--------
A previous study had shown that a mouse Brca1 allele with a premature stop codon at an analogous human 5382 position predisposes mice to breast cancer (53).
--------
Similarly to BLG-cre;Brca1fl/fl;Trp53+/– mice, BLG-cre;Brca1fl/insC;Trp53+/– mice developed mammary tumors with characteristics of basal-like breast adenocarcinoma (49, 51) with near-absent mRNA expression of estrogen and progesterone receptors, as has been reported before for Brca1-null, Trp53-deficient mammary tumors (Supplemental Figure 9 and data not shown, respectively).
--------
In this study we used a well-documented mouse breast cancer model that develops spontaneous tumors which share key features with BRCA1- associated breast cancer in humans [20].
--------
Relative tissue concentrations of choline compounds are higher in docetaxel resistant than in sensitive BRCA1-mutated mouse mammary tumors, but in the first days after docetaxel treatment only in the sensitive tumors an increase of these compounds is observed.
--------
Increased levels of choline metabolites are an early marker of docetaxel treatment response in BRCA1-mutated mouse mammary tumors: an assessment by ex vivo proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy
--------
To study docetaxel resistance, we used a genetically engineered mouse model for BRCA1-mutated breast cancer [14].
--------
In this study we used a well-documented mouse breast cancer model that develops spontaneous tumors which share key features with BRCA1- associated breast cancer in humans [20].
--------
High resolution magic angle spinning (HRMAS) 1H MR spectroscopy was performed on tissue samples obtained from docetaxel-sensitive or -resistant BRCA1-mutated mammary tumors in mice.
--------
The aim of this study was to utilize MR metabolomics to identify potential biomarkers of docetaxel resistance in a mouse model for BRCA1-mutated breast cancer.
--------
In conclusion, this study shows that 1H HRMAS MRS can distinguish between docetaxel sensitive and resistant BRCA1-mutated mouse mammary tumors because they are metabolically distinct.
--------
It has been postulated that BRCA-associated carcinomas may develop and progress more rapidly than sporadic (nonhereditary) BC.22,23 Preneoplastic lesions associated with BRCA1/2 mutations and sporadic BC are different.
--------
More importantly, we report for the first time that silencing Kaiso results in the downregulation of BRCA1 in mutant-p53-expressing TNBC cells.
--------
Indeed, we observed that Kaiso associates with the BRCA1 promoter in both MDA-231 and Hs578T cells (Figure 6d) but more importantly, we also found that high Kaiso and BRCA1 expression correlates with poor overall survival in TNBC patients, as well as all BCa cases in general (Figures 7a and b).
--------
An unexpected finding of this study was that Kaiso depletion reduced BRCA1 expression at both the transcript and protein levels in TNBC cells, suggesting that BRCA1 may be a Kaiso target gene.
--------
Notably, Kaiso depletion downregulates BRCA1 expression in TNBC cells expressing mutant-p53 and we found that high Kaiso and BRCA1 expression correlates with a poor overall survival in breast cancer patients.
--------
As BRCA1 expression has been linked to the resistance of TNBC cells to Cisplatin,10, 36 we examined the effect of Kaiso depletion on BRCA1 expression.
--------
Indeed, we observed that Kaiso associates with the BRCA1 promoter in both MDA-231 and Hs578T cells (Figure 6d) but more importantly, we also found that high Kaiso and BRCA1 expression correlates with poor overall survival in TNBC patients, as well as all BCa cases in general (Figures 7a and b).
--------
Our results demonstrate that the BMI‐1/CDKN2D axis in luminal A cells and the BMI‐1/BRCA1 signaling pathway in TNBC cells are critical for cell proliferation and migration.
--------
BMI‐1 promotes proliferation and migration via transcriptional inhibition of cyclin‐dependent kinase inhibitor 2D (CDKN2D) in luminal A‐type breast cancer but via transcriptional inhibition of breast cancer susceptibility gene 1 (BRCA1) in TNBC.
--------
To further clarify whether the repression of BRCA1 in TNBC cell lines and CDKN2D in luminal A cell lines contributed to the pro‐tumor effect of BMI‐1 in breast cancer cells, MDA‐MB‐231 and MDA‐MB‐468 were used as representative cell lines for TNBC, and MCF‐7 and T47D for luminal A. Similarly, treatment with PTC‐209 led to the downregulation of BMI‐1 in a dose‐dependent manner in MDA‐MB‐468 (Figure 6A,B) and T47D (Figure 7A,B).
--------
Our results reveal that BMI‐1 transcriptionally suppressed BRCA1 in TNBC cell lines whereas, in luminal A cell lines, CDKN2D was the target gene.

We suggest that BMI‐1 promotes proliferation and migration via transcriptional inhibition of CDKN2D in luminal A‐type breast cancer but via transcriptional inhibition of BRCA1 in TNBC.
--------
Knockdown of BRCA1 in TNBC cell lines and CDKN2D in luminal A cell lines with PTC‐209 treatment restores breast cancer progression
--------
These findings help to explain how BRCA1 mutation may perturb the differentiation hierarchy present in the normal mammary gland and why it is associated with the genesis of breast cancers that are genomically unstable and typically display a basal-like transcriptome.
--------
BRCA1 deficiency is associated with the genesis of breast cancers that are genomically unstable and typically display a basal-like transcriptome [1], thus resembling the cells that constitute the outer “basal” layer of the normal adult human mammary gland.
--------
These tumor-suppressive actions may be specific for BRCA1, as polymorphisms in HMMR modify breast cancer risk associated with mutations in BRCA1 but not BRCA2 [23].
--------
Such a postulate is supported by the report that the LP fraction is proportionally increased in nonmalignant mammary tissue obtained from mutant BRCA1 carriers [4] and our observations of more pronounced effects in the BRCA1-shRNA transduced BCs relative to their donor-matched LPs.

The authors assumed that ALDH1 could serve as biomarker of BRCA1 mutations and potential therapeutic target in BRCA1-mutant breast cancer 210.

One year later Heerma van Voss et al. published a paper comparing expression of ALDH1 in epithelium and stroma of tissues obtained from BRCA1 related breast cancers versus sporadic breast cancers.

It has been shown that some of the DNA damage checkpoint and repair genes including Brca1 are highly upregulated in CSC populations in a mouse model of mammary tumor that closely mimics human breast cancer 201.

--------
Taken together, these results suggested that BRCA1 can contribute to the development of aggressive breast cancer phenotype through inhibition of PRC2 complex.
--------
Loss of BRCA1 expression results in EZH2 re-targeting and epigenetic silencing of tumor suppressor genes in human breast cancer cells.
--------
The authors assumed that ALDH1 could serve as biomarker of BRCA1 mutations and potential therapeutic target in BRCA1-mutant breast cancer 210.

Compared to sporadic controls, expression of ALDH1 in tumors was higher in BRCA1-mutated breast cancers suggesting that BRCA1 related breast tumors have increased CSC population.
--------
Here, we have examined the interaction between LYN kinase and BRCA1 loss-of-function in an in vivo mouse mammary tumour model, using conditional knockout Brca1 and Lyn alleles.
--------
LYN kinase is expressed in BRCA1 loss-of-function-dependent mouse mammary tumours, in the cells of origin of such tumours, and in human breast cancer.
--------
Conditional<i>in vivo</i>deletion of LYN kinase has little effect on a<i>BRCA1</i>loss-of-function-associated mammary tumour model
--------
Suppressing LYN kinase activity in BRCA1-defective cell lines, as well as in in vitro cultures of Brca1 -null mouse mammary tumours, is deleterious to their growth.
--------
Comparison of Brca1 tumour cohorts showed little difference in mammary tumour formation between animals that were wild type, heterozygous or homozygous for the conditional Lyn allele, although this was confounded by factors including incomplete Lyn recombination in some tumours.

--------
A transition from the luminal phenotype to the basal-like transcriptome may be the key to explaining the specific risk of breast cancer conferred by BRCA1 haploinsufficiency (Zhang et al., 2019).
--------
BRCA1 conditional knockout in female mice (conditional in mammary tissue) carrying a P53 heterozygous mutation induced mammary tumors with the loss of the remaining wild-type P53 allele due to genome instability and the presence of similar genomic and histopathologic features to the human basal-like malignant breast tumors carrying both BRCA1 and P53 mutations (Liu et al., 2007).

--------
Moreover, Brn-3b but not Brn-3a can strongly repress the BRCA-1 promoter approximately 20-fold in mammary tumour cells.
--------
We show here that mammary tumours which have reduced levels of BRCA-1 expression show enhanced expression of the Brn-3b POU family transcription factor at both the mRNA and protein levels.
--------
Thus, Brn-3b may play an important role in regulating expression of BRCA-1 in mammary tumours with enhanced expression of Brn-3b resulting in reduced BRCA-1 expression and thereby being potentially important in tumour development.
--------
The Brn-3b POU family transcription factor represses expression of the BRCA-1 anti-oncogene in breast cancer cells.

We investigated the regulatory mechanisms of non-tumorigenic human breast epithelial (MCF10A), triple negative breast cancer with a wild-type BRCA1 expression (MDA-MB-231) and triple negative breast cancer with a common homozygous BRCA1 5382insC mutation (HCC1937) using a multi-omics approach including DNA methylation, RNAseq, protein, phosphopeptides analysis, and histone post-translational modifications (Fig. 1).

We also observed this in a genetically engineered K14cre;Brca1F/F;Trp53F/F (KB1P) mouse model for BRCA1-mutated breast cancer.
--------
For this purpose, KB1P4N organoids, derived from a Brca1−/−;Trp53−/− mammary tumor (41), were transduced with lentiviruses carrying Lrrc8a or Lrrc8d targeting pLENTiCRISPRv2 vectors.
--------
To investigate the effects of LRRC8A or LRRC8D defects on Pt drug sensitivity in HR-deficient tumors, we generated CRISPR/Cas9 KOs in cell lines derived from a genetically engineered mouse model for hereditary BRCA1-mutated breast cancer (25).
--------
Here, we confirm the relevance of these proteins for sensitivity to Pt drugs, using Pt drug–sensitive BRCA1;p53-deficient mouse mammary tumors and cell lines derived from this model.
--------
Using a mouse model for BRCA1-mutated breast cancer, we show here the relevance of LRRC8A- and LRRC8D-mediated cisplatin and carboplatin uptake to kill Pt drug–sensitive tumors.
--------
Here, we show that the loss of LRRC8A or LRRC8D significantly reduces the uptake of cisplatin and carboplatin in BRCA1;p53-deficient mouse mammary tumor cells.

<b>Purpose:</b> We aimed to characterize and target drug-tolerant BRCA1-deficient tumor cells that cause residual disease and subsequent tumor relapse.<b>Experimental Design:</b> We studied responses to various mono- and bifunctional alkylating agents in a genetically engineered mouse model for <i>BRCA1/p53</i>-mutant breast cancer.

This is consistent with our <i>in vivo</i> finding that the nimustine MTD, among several alkylating agents, is the most effective in eradicating <i>Brca1</i>-mutated mouse mammary tumors.<b>Conclusions:</b> Our data show that targeting G<sub>0</sub>-like cells is crucial for the eradication of BRCA1/p53-deficient tumor cells.

Moreover, Bernard-Gallon et al. observed an increase of BRCA1 and BRCA2 mRNA expressions in DHA-treated BC cell lines, suggesting the presence of a possible transcriptional or post-transcriptional regulation of BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes after omega-3 PUFAs treatment in BC cells (Bernard-Gallon et al., 2002).

To our knowledge, no immunohistochemical data was available regarding the relationship between CSC marker CD44 and BRCA1 in an unselected series (either family or sporadic) of breast carcinomas.

In the present experimental study we examined the expression and localization of the BRCA1 protein and investigated the prognostic value as well as its relationship with the putative cancer stem cell (CSC) marker (CD44) in 156 tumour samples from a well-characterized series of unselected breast carcinomas using immunohistochemistry.

More importantly, treatment of Brca1/p53-deficient mice with progesterone antagonist mifepristone (RU 486) prevented mammary tumorigenesis, providing additional in vivo evidence of the involvement of the progesterone signaling pathway in BRCA1-related mammary tumor development.
--------
In fact, animal studies showed that activation of the estrogen signaling pathway collaborates with loss of Brca1 to promote both ERα- and ERα+ mammary tumor development 33, suggesting that ERα+ tumor cells would not be excluded by loss of mouse Brca1.
--------
The answer to the ERα- nature of BRCA1-related breast cancer may lie in another interplay of BRCA1 and hormone action.

Here we show that, in basal-like and BRCA1-related breast cancer (BC), ROS levels correlate with the expression and activity of the transcription factor aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR).
--------
AhR controls redox homeostasis and shapes the tumor microenvironment in BRCA1-associated breast cancer.
--------
Thus, AhR represents an attractive target to inhibit redox homeostasis and modulate the tumor promoting microenvironment of basal-like and BRCA1-associated BC.

BRCA1 overexpression sensitizes cancer cells to lovastatin via regulation of cyclin D1-CDK4-p21WAF1/CIP1 pathway: analyses using a breast cancer cell line and tumoral xenograft model.

Our results suggest that BRCA1 overexpression sensitizes cancer cells to lovastatin via regulation of cyclin D1-CDK4-p21WAF1/CIP1 pathway, which will provide an innovative experimental framework to study control of breast cancer cell proliferation.

MCF-7 cells, which have only one wild-type BRCA1 allele, were transfected with pcDNA3-beta-HA-hsBRCA1 plasmids via liposomes to reconstitute BRCA1 overexpression human breast cancer cell line, and tumoral xenografts with BRCA1 overexpression were subsequently established in BALB/c nude mice.

The purpose of this study was to investigate whether breast cancer susceptibility gene 1 (BRCA1) overexpression sensitizes mammary cancer cells to statins.

Drost et al. demonstrated that the Brca1 (C61G) missense mutation, which impairs BRCA1/BARD1 heterodimerization and ubiquitin ligase activity, resulted in mammary tumors that were resistant to cisplatin and PARP inhibitors compared to Brca1 null mice [25].

These human and rodent studies support an origin of BRCA1-mutation associated breast cancer (and indeed of the majority of sporadic basal-like breast cancers) in a luminal ER negative mammary epithelial progenitor.
--------
In the mouse, targeted deletion of Brca1 in luminal ER negative progenitors resulted in the formation of mammary tumours which phenocopied human BRCA1 breast tumour pathology, while the deletion of Brca1 in basal stem cells resulted in the formation of tumours which neither resembled human BRCA1 tumours or sporadic basal-like breast tumours.

Thus, we found that in transient transfection assays using a progesterone responsive reporter (MMTV-Luc), exogenous wild-type BRCA1 [but not a cancer-associated mutant (T300G)] inhibited the activity of the PR in progesterone-responsive human breast cancer cells (MCF-7 and T47D).

Because both p53 and BRCA1 are involved in DNA damage response, it is likely that increasing sustained DNA damage is a risk factor for preferentially developing ER− breast cancer.
--------
We examined human TNBC cell lines harboring wild-type and mutant BRCA1 and found that WWOX expression promoted NHEJ repair in cells with wild-type BRCA1.
--------
Since both BRCA1 and WWOX are commonly inactivated in TNBC and are involved in DNA repair, we set to test whether inactivation of both proteins would affect mammary tumorigenesis in vivo.
--------
Whether WWOX cooperates with BRCA1 to suppress BLBCs and TNBCs is unknown.
--------
Furthermore, we tested the effect of WWOX expression on DNA DSB repair pathway choice when BRCA1 is either wild-type or mutant in human TNBC cell lines.
--------
In this study, we investigated the interplay between WWOX and BRCA1, both frequently inactivated in TNBC, on mammary tumor development and on DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair choice.
--------
To learn more about the role of WWOX and BRCA1 in immediate response to DSB repair of human TNBC, we used MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-436 cell lines.
--------
Given that WWOX and BRCA1 have been implicated in BLBC/TNBC and previously reported as interacting partners [17, 38, 39], we tested whether their targeted loss synergizes to affect mammary tumorigenesis in vivo.

Notably, BCs display loss of heterozygosity (LOH) of BRCA1 as well as reduced BRCA1 mRNA expression due to promoter DNA methylation of the remaining allele [126,127,128,129,130].
--------
As a result, the mutation of BRCA1 results in EMT being induced, which promotes metastasis of breast cancer cells [61].
--------
Downregulation of BRCA1 has been associated with a significant increase in the CSC-like populations in breast cancer cells, whereas BRCA1 reconstitution increases cell sensitivity to HDAC inhibitor-induced loss of stemness, thus suggesting that BRCA1 functions as a breast stem cell regulator, while its status may determine tumor response to therapy [283].

Cooperativity of Rb, Brca1, and p53 in Malignant Breast Cancer Evolution
--------
Only a single mouse (n = 13), doubly defective for Rbf and Brca1 activity (TgMFT121;TgWAP-Cre;Brca1f/f), developed mammary tumors at 386 days following Cre induction by multiple pregnancies.
--------
Because genomic instability is a hallmark of malignant transformation [35], especially among BRCA1 familial cancers [36] and aggressive sporadic breast cancers [37], we hypothesized that Brca1 mutation would accelerate the tumor development we observed following dual inactivation of pRbf and p53. Our results show that concomitant inactivation of all three tumor suppressor pathways in mammary epithelium has an additive effect on tumor latency and predisposes highly penetrant, malignant carcinomas.
--------
In this study we show that mammary tumors caused by inactivation of the pRb family (pRbf) of proteins (pRb, p107, p130), together with Brca1 and p53 inactivation, mimic several aspects of the most aggressive forms of breast cancer, including rapid tumor progression, poor differentiation, distant metastasis, necrosis, metaplasia, and genomic instability.

In this paper we show that OPG, which is the physiological antagonist of RANKL (a factor known to be crucially involved in breast carcinogenesis), is low in women who have inherited a gene mutation (i.e. in BRCA1 or 2) which puts them at extremely high risk of developing breast cancer.

Cell fate takes a slug in BRCA1-associated breast cancer

An important study by Molyneux et al. [7] conditionally deleted Brca1 in different epithelial populations (heterozygous for p53) and revealed that luminal rather than basal cells were predisposed to basal-like mammary tumors.

The ability to isolate discrete epithelial subpopulations from mammary tissue has recently directed attention to luminal progenitor cells - the descendants of mammary stem cells - as the likely 'cells-of-origin' in BRCA1-associated breast cancer.

These in vivo experiments provided direct evidence that BRCA1-associated breast cancers can arise from luminal ER-negative progenitors.

A positive feedback loop exists between ER and BRCA1 expression; however, BRCA1 is likely not essential for ER expression.132 We propose that ER+ BRCA1-deficient epithelial cells are converted to ER-negative BCs through the prolonged ER-dependent DSB formation in BRCA1-deficient ER+ epithelial cells during E2 exposure,60 which activates ATM and then stabilizes p53, which leads to cell senescence.133 Thus, the loss of ER and p53 is likely to confer a considerable growth advantage on BRCA1-deficient malignant cells.

Basal-like and HER2+ tumors exhibited a higher frequency of ALDH1+ cells compared to luminal tumors, and a higher percentage of CD44+/CD24− cells is mainly attributed to TNBC and to BRCA1-mutated BC [51,91].

Unlike conditional Brca1-null (Brca1co/−/Wapcre/+ and Brca1co/co/Wapcre/+) females, which develop basal-like mammary tumors at a high frequency [26], all conditional-null Ctip animals remained mammary tumor-free over the 24-month observation period (Figure 3C), as did the control animals (n = 10; Ctipco/+/Wapcre/+) (data not shown).
--------
Nevertheless, mammary-specific inactivation of either the Brca1, Bard1, or Brca2 gene readily induces mammary tumors [25, 26, 30–32, 35] despite the fact that mice lacking expression of these genes also die during early embryogenesis [36–41].

It is possible that CtIP has weak tumor suppression activity (relative to BRCA1) such that its inactivation does not appreciably affect the kinetics of mammary tumor formation in our mouse model.

Overall, resveratrol increased H3K9ac and H3K27ac activity, while reducing repressive histone marks (H4R3me2s and H3K27me3) and increasing the level of activating histone marks (H3K9/27ac) in the proximal promoter region of the tumor suppressor genes BRCA1, p53, and p21. The authors observed that the effects of resveratrol were more pronounced in TNBC cells MDA-MB-231, compared to ER positive MCF7 cells.

--------
We recently extended our studies in TNBC cell lines showing that genistein upregulated BRCA-1 expression leading to expression of ERα, and these effects were linked to acquired sensitivity of TNBC cells to the growth inhibitory effects of tamoxifen (78).

In contrast, the dually-labeled tumors derived from CST cells and host stroma show complete response to cisplatin treatment, a first-line therapy of BRCA1-mutated breast cancers.

Over the years, the K14cre; Brca1F/F; p53F/F mouse model of hereditary breast cancer has proved to be a useful tool to study tumor response and acquired therapy resistance of BRCA1-deficient breast cancers [45,46,47,48,49].

Loss of BRCA1 in epithelial tissues leads to mammary tumors, with long latency and low frequency [41,42].

Lack of ABCG2 shortens latency of BRCA1-deficient mammary tumors and this is not affected by genistein or resveratrol.

To address this issue, we used a newer generation mouse model of BRCA1-mutated breast cancer and examined tumor latency in K14cre;Brca1(F/F); p53(F/F), Abcb1a/b(-/-);K14cre;Brca1(F/F); p53(F/F), or Abcg2(-/-);K14cre;Brca1(F/F); p53(F/F) animals, fed with genistein- or resveratrol-supplemented diets.

Mice with Brca1 and Trp53 loss develop basal-like HR-negative mammary tumors, and mice with inhibition of proteins of the Rb family and Trp53 loss or the combination of Rb, Trp53 and Brca1 aberrations develop luminal ductal carcinoma that is positive for ER, PR and Her2 expression, but endocrine resistant.

We show that although Brca1- and Brca2-deficient mouse mammary tumors have a defect in the homologous recombination pathway, there is no apparent difference in the type or frequency of somatic rearrangements found in these cancers when compared to other mouse mammary cancers, and tumors from all genetic backgrounds showed evidence of microhomology-mediated repair and non-homologous end-joining processes.

Overall our work suggests an answer to the long-standing question of why germline BRCA1 mutations cause tissue-specific tumors, in showing how tissue-specific, ROS-induced DNA lesions create a nongenetic force to promote mammary tumors in BRCA1-deficient mice.
--------
However, estrogen may be important in the pathogenesis of BRCA1-associated BC [27] and tamoxifen and raloxifene may act as preventive agents in BRCA1 carriers by binding to estrogen receptor beta [28].

BSO, a strategy embraced by many of the clinicians in the study, reduces incidence of BRCA1-associated breast cancer also presumably by a hormonal mechanism.

In the present study, we demonstrate that immunoreactivity of Brca1 was reduced in almost all rat mammary carcinomas induced by 2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine (PhIP), whereas hypermethylation of its promoter, mutations in its entire coding region, and decreased mRNA expression were absent.

Functional antagonism between BRCA1 and COBRA1 in R-loop regulation can be recapitulated in human breast cancer cells in vitro [85].
--------
Thus, despite the fact that BRCA1-associated breast tumors tend to be basal-like and triple-negative, both clinical and preclinical studies strongly suggest that luminal progenitor cells are the cell-of-origin of BRCA1-mutated breast cancers [22,23,26] (Figure 1b).

In breast cancer cell lines, BRCA1 is shown to positively regulate FOXA1 and FOXO3 expression by interfering with EZH2-mediated promoter methylation [112,113].
--------
RANK+ luminal progenitors in BRCA1 mutation carriers are highly proliferative, and inhibition of its ligand RANKL attenuates mammary tumor formation in Brca1 knockout mice [25].
--------
Further functional characterization of the above-mentioned mouse genetic models reveals that Cobra1 deletion reduces Brca1-associated mammary tumorigenesis [85], thus clearly demonstrating mutual functional antagonism between these two genes in both normal tissue development and mammary tumor formation.
--------
Tissue-specific BRCA1 knockout mice develop spontaneous mammary tumors at a long latency, and the tumor formation is significantly accelerated with Trp53 inactivation [62,63].
--------
A mutagenic escape mechanism may also exist in HER2+ BC brain metastases, which are devoid of pathogenic BRCA1 mutations, but show a gene expression signature corresponding to BRCA1-deficient BC cells [113].
--------
Intriguingly, this R-loop preventive effect of BRCA1 contributes to breast epithelial cell differentiation from luminal progenitor to mature luminal cells, which can explain why BRCA1-mutated basal-like BC originates from more primitive luminal progenitor cells [17].
--------
BRCA1 transcriptionally represses basal-like cytokeratins, so that loss or inhibition of BRCA1 increases the subpopulation of BC cells with stemness markers like ALDH1 and improves spheroid growth [176].
--------
On the other hand, DNA damage response and repair genes, including BRCA1, have been found to be upregulated in BCSCs of a mouse mammary gland tumor model [120] and in brain metastases of BC patients [74], suggesting that CTCs presenting SC features encounter conditions that require efficient removal of DNA lesions.

Deregulated expression of BRCA1 as a result of aberrant IGF signaling might bear consequences in breast cancer development (41).
--------
Among other physiological activities, BRCA1 was shown to induce the metabolic reprogramming of breast cancer cells with ensuing reversal of the Warburg effect.
--------
Consistent with this inhibitory role, BRCA1-deficient mammary tumor cells exhibited high levels of IRS-1.
--------
Consistent with its tumor suppressor role, wild-type BRCA1 was shown to repress IGF1R gene transcription and promoter activity as well as endogenous IGF1R levels in breast cancer cells (43, 44).
--------
The BRCA1-induced metabolic reprogramming of breast cancer cells was examined using global metabolomics and transcriptomics platforms (67).
--------
As a corollary, maintaining physiological levels of glucose may improve BRCA1 function and delay breast cancer progression.
--------
In addition to breast cancer, BRCA1 was identified as a transcriptional repressor of the IGF1R gene in prostate and endometrial cancer cells (50–53).
--------
Similarly, introduction of patient‐relevant Brca1 mutations in a conditional mouse model of BRCA1‐associated breast cancer showed that, in contrast to Brca1‐null tumors, mammary tumors with expression of Brca1 alleles harboring mutations in the RING domain readily acquired resistance to DNA‐damaging drugs due to residual activity of the RING‐less BRCA1 protein (Drost et al, 2011, 2016).
--------
For example, the GEMM‐ESC strategy was used to introduce the Met proto‐oncogene in a GEMM of BRCA1‐associated breast cancer, which yielded a novel mouse model of BRCA1‐deficient metaplastic breast cancer (Henneman et al, 2015).

--------
While BRCA1‐related basal‐like breast cancer was previously postulated to originate from basal epithelial stem cells, cell‐of‐origin studies in GEMMs revealed that in fact, luminal progenitors are the source of basal‐like tumors (Molyneux et al, 2010).

A clear example of a preclinical GEMM that has provided mechanistic insight into therapy response and resistance of BRCA1‐mutated breast cancer is the K14cre;Brca1F/F;Trp53F/F (KB1P) mouse model.

--------
Thus, the ability of BRCA1 to inhibit estrogen receptor activity (described above) could contribute to breast cancer suppression.
--------
In this study, BRCA1 deficiency led to the loss of transcriptional repression of satellite DNA in mouse mammary tumors, human breast cancers, and cultured cells and to loss of ubiquitinated histone H2A within the satellite repeats.
--------
By the same reasoning, it appears that a p53 mutation is required for BRCA1-related breast cancer development because otherwise, chromosoml aberrations due to BRCA1 deficiency would activate p53, leading to cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, and/or senescence of the tumor cells.
--------
In this study, BRCA1 deficiency led to the loss of transcriptional repression of satellite DNA in mouse mammary tumors, human breast cancers, and cultured cells and to loss of ubiquitinated histone H2A within the satellite repeats.

Thus, the functional interaction of BRCA1 and p53 is quite complex and may influence the molecular pathogenesis of breast cancer, the DDR of tumor cells, and their sensitivity to DNA damaging agents including chemotherapy drugs and IR.
--------
Hereditary breast cancers in BRCA1 mutation carriers are mostly estrogen receptor α (ERα)-negative and progesterone receptor (PR)-negative; however, hormone depletion via bilateral oophorectomy does result in a marked reduction in breast cancer risk, suggesting that BRCA1-associated breast tumorigenesis is dependent on hormone signaling.
--------
In line with the human data, BRCA1-deficient mouse mammary tumors are ERα-negative, and bilateral ovariectomy leads to abrogation of mammary tumor development.

In otherwise histologically normal tissue of BRCA1 mutation carriers, luminal progenitors positive for RANK expression were shown to be highly proliferative, aberrant in DNA repair, and possessed a basal‐like breast cancer molecular signature (Nolan et al, 2016).
--------
A study has shown that BRCA1 mutation carriers possess an abnormally expanded luminal progenitor pool prior to cancer onset, and mice with tissue‐specific deletion of Brca1 and p53 in the luminal lineage develop mammary cancers that resemble human BRCA1 tumors histologically (Lim et al, 2009; Molyneux et al, 2010).
--------
It has also been shown that luminal progenitors can give rise to basal‐like breast cancers following oncogenic insults, irrespective of BRCA1 (Koren et al, 2015; Van Keymeulen et al, 2015; Hein et al, 2016).
--------
This is relevant since luminal progenitors are the likely cell‐of‐origin for BRCA1‐mutated breast cancer, and the dysregulated levels of R‐loops seen in cancers lead to genomic instability (Aguilera & García‐Muse, 2012).
--------
Genetically engineered mouse models deficient in genes such as Brca1 and p53 exhibit pre‐neoplastic events such as increased numbers of mammary stem/progenitors and hyperplasia followed by multiple mammary tumors (Brodie et al, 2001; Evers & Jonkers, 2006).
--------
The histone methyltransferase EZH2 is another candidate for intervention as it is overexpressed in BRCA1 normal breast tissue and implicated in mammary stem cell expansion as well as breast cancer (Ding et al, 2006).

Progesterone proves pro‐tumorigenic in both carcinogen‐induced or Brca1 loss‐driven breast cancer pre‐clinical models (Lydon et al, 1999; Gonzalez‐Suarez et al, 2010; Schramek et al, 2010; Tanos et al, 2013; Lee et al, 2016).

Conditional knock out of either Brca1 or Bard1 in murine mammary epithelial cells led to the development of mammary carcinomas that are indistinguishable from each other (Shakya et al., 2008), and the BRCA1 C61G mutant that abrogates BARD1 binding failed to suppress mammary tumor development in mice (Drost et al., 2011).

--------
In the context of oxidative stress, BRCA1 overexpression in human breast cancer cells up-regulates several antioxidant genes and reduces H2O2-induced DNA damage and apoptosis (Bae et al., 2004; Saha et al., 2009).
--------
To determine whether human BRCA1-mutated tumor cells retain a defective NRF2 antioxidant response, we analyzed human breast cancer HCC1937 cells (Scully et al., 1999) either carrying a 5382insC BRCA1 mutation (HCCmut) or reconstituted with WT BRCA1 (HCCWT).
--------
To determine whether E2-regulated signaling can counteract Nrf2 defective response induced by BRCA1 loss, we treated the E2-responsive human breast cancer cell line MCF7 with 17-β estradiol (E2).
--------
Moreover, PAH exposure activates the expression of AhR (aryl hydrocarbon receptor).[47] AhR may act as a transcription factor to perform the transcription of a wide range of genes that may exhibit the biological and toxicological effects of PAHs.[48] It has been reported that AhR inhibited BRCA1 transcription in MCF7, UACC3199, and HCC38 BC cells.[49] However, whether BPDE might regulate HR repair through AhR in human trophoblast cells is completely unknown and should be investigated.
--------
It has been reported that AhR (aryl hydrocarbon receptor) could bind with the promoter (chr 17: 43125372–43125499) of BRCA1 and inhibit BRCA1 transcription in MCF7, UACC3199, and HCC38 BC cell lines.[49] However, whether and how AhR affected BRCA1 transcription in human trophoblast cells was unknown.

Early attempts to create animal models for BRCA1 associated breast cancer were not successful, as BRCA1 deficiency invariably results in embryonic lethality, primarily due to elevated cell death and growth retardation (28,29).
--------
This data indicated that inactivation of p53 and Brca1 deficiency synergistically induce mammary tumor formation.
--------
Furthermore, mammary tumors developed from a mouse model carrying a mammary specific disruption of Brca1 exhibit extensive chromosome aneuploidy (25).

Development of 'synthetic lethal' strategies to target BRCA1-deficient breast cancer.
--------
A new study provides further preclinical validation of this concept by demonstrating that BRCA1-deficient mouse mammary tumor cells are selectively sensitive to an inhibitor of the polycomb gene EZH2.
--------
This is the first report of a non-BRCA1/2-mutated BC with somatic homozygous and germ-line heterozygous deletion of the entire BARD1 gene.
--------
BARD1 homozygous deletion, a possible alternative to BRCA1 mutation in basal breast cancer.
--------
Consistently, Brca1-deficient mouse mammary tumors exhibit accelerated growth, pronounced vascularization, and overexpressed ANG1.
--------
Removal of BRCA1/CtIP/ZBRK1 repressor complex on ANG1 promoter leads to accelerated mammary tumor growth contributed by prominent vasculature.
--------
We have evaluated this putative synthetic lethality in a genetically engineered mouse model for BRCA1-associated breast cancer, using the topoisomerase I (Top1) poison topotecan as monotherapy and in combination with poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibition by olaparib.
--------
Sensitivity and acquired resistance of BRCA1;p53-deficient mouse mammary tumors to the topoisomerase I inhibitor topotecan.
--------
Mechanistically, BRCA1 bound to the TWIST promoter, suppressing its activity and inhibiting EMT in mammary tumor cells.
--------
In parallel, TWIST expression and EMT features correlated inversely with BRCA1 expression in human breast cancers.
--------
Yet, how BRCA1 suppresses formation of basal-like breast cancers is still obscure.
--------
Alternately, germline mutation of Brca1 shifts the fate of luminal cells to cause luminal-to-basal mammary tumor transformation.
--------
The development of mammary tumours in conditional BRCA1 and BRCA2 knockout mice was considerably accelerated in a Trp53 knockout background (Evers and Jonkers, 2006).
--------
Loss of BRCA1 may contribute to tumor development in breast carcinomas, which may be independent of the p53 tumor suppressor.
--------
Our group (53) reported that resveratrol effectively reversed several epigenetic changes associated with activation of the AhR and its binding to the BRCA1 promoter, in ER/PR positive breast cancer (MCF-7) cells.
--------
Inactivation of TP53 is a requirement for tumor progression in BRCA1 deficient BC, and current therapies include treatment with HDAC inhibitors.
--------
To address this hypothesis, we immunohistochemically-profiled a panel of key factors involved in DNA-damage signalling network (ATR, ATM, pChk1, Chk2, p53), double strand break repair (BRCA1, DNA-PKcs, TOPO2) and base excision repair (pol β, FEN1, APE1, XRCC1, SMUG1, PARP1) in a large cohort of 880 ER-breast cancers (including 635 TNBCs) with long term follow-up data.
--------
Additionally, the pharmacological blockade of RANKL using RANK-Fc completely abolished the development of precancerous lesions in the Brca1/Tp53 double-mutated breast cancer model (90).
--------
In a pilot clinical study, termed BRCA-D, the proliferation marker Ki67 was significantly down-regulated in the breast biopsy of BRCA1 mutation carriers who received short-term treatment with Denosumab, suggesting that RANKL inhibition may be a feasible method for the chemo-prevention of breast cancer in women with BRCA1 mutations.
--------
In addition to the now experimentally well validated role of RANKL/RANK/OPG in the sex hormone and BRCA1 mutation-driven mammary cancer tumorigenesis, it has also been reported that this pathway can induce epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in breast cancer cells, as well as in prostate and endometrial cancers (95–98), suggesting that RANKL/RANK supports tumorigenesis in various epithelial cancers.

--------
Amplification of RANK-expressing mammary duct progenitor cells can be found in the non-tumor breast tissue of BRCA1 mutant carriers, and these cells have similar molecular characteristics as basal-like breast cancer cells (90).
--------
Recently we and other groups have provided direct genetic and pharmacological proof that the RANKL/RANK pathway plays an essential role in the progression of familial BRCA1-mutated associated breast cancer.
--------
Furthermore, the meta-expression analysis of breast cancer patients has uncovered a positive association between metastases and ERRα/RANK expression as well as a positive correlation between ERRα and BRCA1 mutation carriers, revealing a novel pathway whereby ERRα in primary breast cancer could promote early dissemination of cancer cells to bone (150).
--------
Since thousands of women have received the RANKL blocking antibody Denosumab to treat osteoporosis thus highlighting its safety profile, we believe that targeting the RANKL/RANK pathway with Denosumab is indeed a feasible strategy for the prevention of breast cancer in BRCA1-mutation carriers and may also be effective for other women at high risk for developing breast cancer.
--------
Altogether, these human data strongly support the idea that the RANKL/RANK/OPG axis is intimately involved in the tumorigenesis of BRCA1/2 mutation-driven breast cancer.

BRCA1-associated ring domain (BARD1), a direct interacting partner of BRCA1, is likely to be a low–moderate penetrance BC risk gene [54].

Considering the important roles of BRCA1, BRCA2, CDH1, PTEN, TP53, PIK3CA in BC, we also evaluated these gene expression between gene high-risk and low-risk groups, and observed that the expression of oncogenes such as BRCA1, BRCA2 and CDH1 were significantly higher in high-risk group.

Our data suggest that hypomorphic BRCA1 isoforms contribute to HRR restoration in gBRCA1 BC [20, 21].

However, interestingly, Molyneux et al. (79) demonstrated that deletion of BRCA1 in mammary luminal epithelial cells—targeted by Blg—can generate basal-like breast tumors, phenocopying the human BRCA1-associated breast cancers, while the deficiency of BRCA1 in basal cells– targeted by CK14– can only generate the malignant adenomyoepitheliomas which are rare in human BRCA1-associated breast cancer.

BRCA1 driven triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) has been shown to arise from luminal progenitors yet little is known about how BRCA1 loss-of-function (LOF) and concomitant mutations affect the luminal progenitor cell state.
--------
To explore this in more detail, we used the Brca1/p53 TNBC mouse model (Blg-Cre; Brca1f/f;p53+/−) that harbours a conditional Brca1 LOF in the luminal progenitor compartment.
--------
The analysis so far suggests that the early stages of TNBC development in the Brca1/p53 model are primarily characterised by the cell-autonomous differentiation of the luminal progenitor compartment.
--------
Furthermore, BRCA1-associated breast cancers often harbor p53 mutations [7–11], leading to a simultaneous dysfunction of the homologous recombination (HR) pathway and the p53 network.

Recently published results show that mifepristone, but not the vitamin treatment placebo, reduced both the mitotic age and proportion of luminal progenitor cells in the normal breast tissue of healthy women and BRCA1/2 mutation carriers (124), suggesting mifepristone may be suitable for breast cancer prevention.

We present evidence that (i) TBXA2R is transcriptionally repressed by a BRCA1/c-Myc complex, (ii) components of the Rho/ROCK pathway may be important mediators of TBXA2R signalling in TNBCs, (iii) TBXA2R may have roles in controlling endogenous ROS levels and DNA damage and (iv) whilst this receptor is a biomarker of poor prognosis in breast cancer overall, it may possess potential to serve as a predictive marker of good outcomes to DNA damage therapies in TNBCs.
--------
In contrast to BRCA1, c-Myc is often amplified in TNBC/BLBCs and has been particularly associated with loss of functional BRCA1 [36], therefore, further investigation is required into the effect of c-Myc on TBXA2R transcription in the absence of BRCA1.
--------
We have also shown for the first time that TBXA2R is transcriptionally repressed by BRCA1 (a tumour suppressor often mutated or down-regulated in TNBC), providing a potential mechanism by which TBXA2R is up-regulated in TNBC/BLBCs.

BRIP1 cloned to a GAL4 DNA-binding domain showed strong transcriptional repression independent of its ability to bind BRCA1 (S900A) or its helicase activity (K52R) (20), thus indicating its amplification in sporadic breast cancer.

Consistent with BRCA1 being a downstream target of IRX5, there was significant correlation between BRCA1 and IRX5 gene expression in breast-invasive carcinoma (Figure 7G), suggesting that the regulatory relationship between IRX5 and BRCA1 extends beyond epidermal keratinocytes.

Finally, we found an inverse correlation between HMGA1 and BRCA1 mRNA and protein expression in human mammary carcinoma cell lines and tissues.
--------
These data indicate that HMGA1 proteins are involved in transcriptional regulation of the BRCA1 gene, and their overexpression may have a role in BRCA1 downregulation observed in aggressive mammary carcinomas.
--------
These data indicate that HMGA1 proteins are involved in transcriptional regulation of the BRCA1 gene, and their overexpression may have a role in BRCA1 downregulation observed in aggressive mammary carcinomas.
--------
On the basis of this, we hypothesized that alterations in DNA damage response (DDR) pathways before the development of cancer might also be responsible for other phenotypes accompanying BRCA1-associated breast cancers: namely rapid tumour onset, extensive genomic instability and the preferential loss of p53 and pRb.
--------
These results identify a novel form of cellular senescence and provide a potential molecular basis for the rapid cell- and tissue- specific predisposition of breast cancer development associated with BRCA1 haploinsufficiency.
--------
Furthermore, conditional deletion of BRCA1 in mouse mammary epithelial cells does not result in accelerated tumour formation or increased genomic instability; rather, these mice develop mammary tumours at a low frequency and late in life and only on the background of additional genetic mutations such as heterozygosity for p53 (refs 55, 56).
--------
However, genetic studies involving family-based cancer cases and case-control study groups have consistently shown that potentially pathogenic variants in BARD1 are unlikely to: i) confer a high lifetime risk (OR ≥ 5) to BC and OC in heterozygous carriers akin to pathogenic variants described for BRCA1 and BRCA2; and ii) account for the remaining or a significant proportion of heritability of BC and OC attributable to known cancer predisposing genes, especially in cancer syndromes involving these cancer types.
--------
Since the discovery over 20 years ago that BARD1 interacts with BRCA1, numerous studies have investigated the possibility that BARD1 variants may affect risk to the heritable form of BC and OC, and perhaps account for the missing heritability not attributed to BRCA1/BRCA2, historically denoted as “BRCAX”.
--------
This led to the hypothesis that variants in BARD1 could encode an aberrant protein affecting the interaction with BRCA1 and predispose to BC and/or OC, especially in hereditary cancer syndrome families not accounted for by BRCA1 or BRCA2 [6].
--------
Interestingly, conditional knockouts resulting in the inactivation of Bard1 and/or Brca1 resulted in mice that developed BC with histopathologies strikingly similarity to human TNBC, indicating that this is tumourigenic [102].

5.1.1. High ROS Production Derived from BRCA1 Inactivation and TP53 Mutation in TNBC
--------
In this respect, particularly high ROS levels are generated by TNBC cells due to gene mutation/inactivation (e.g., BRCA1 and TP53), gene expression changes, and CSC enrichment.
--------
Particularly, basal-like TNBC cells characterized by inactivated BRCA1 and mutated TP53 produce high ROS levels and rely on ROS signaling for their survival and malignant progression.
--------
The inactivation of breast cancer susceptibility gene 1 (BRCA1) may also be related to high ROS content in basal-like TNBC.
--------
Therefore, the BRCA1 inactivation and TP53 mutation that often observed in TNBC may contribute to a significant ROS content in these cells.
--------
BRCA1-associated BCs have a high frequency of basal-like and triple-negative BC (TNBC) derived from luminal progenitor cells.
--------
Our findings revealed that BRCA1/ZBRK1 complex could have a function in aspartate metabolism, which was partially dependent on transcriptional regulation of GOT2. Importantly, GOT2 was overexpressed in breast cancer (BC), especially in triple‐negative breast cancer (TNBC), and was significantly correlated with poor survival of patients with these diseases.

Similar analysis of fibroblast samples that was based on 3496 differentially expressed genes common to both normal and BCNS fibroblasts resulted in enrichment of canonical pathways involving cell cycle control of chromosomal replication, role of BRCA1 in DNA damage response, mitotic roles of Polo-like kinase, hereditary breast cancer signaling and role of CHK proteins in Cell cycle checkpoint control.
--------
On the other hand, a core analysis of 4959 genes enriched in rapamycin treated BCNS fibroblasts pointed to top canonical pathways that included those playing a role of BRCA1 in DNA damage response, protein ubiquitination pathway, hereditary breast cancer signaling, cell cycle control of chromosomal replication and mitotic roles of Polo-like Kinases (Figure 5D, Table 5D).

[289] where it was shown that this compound has modulated the recruitment of AhR and ERα towards the Brca-1 promoter and antagonized the TCDD-induced histone modifications at this gene which led to an attenuation of the epigenetic changes via different mechanisms such as influencing the binding and interaction between the Brca-1 gene of various histones and enzymes.
--------
Moreover, in breast cancer cells treated with RSV, the expression of Brca1, p53 and p21 was increased by enhancing the abundance of the activating histone marks, namely H3K927ac, in the proximal promoter region and reducing the enrichment of repressive histone marks, H4R3me2s and H3K27me3.

However, given that the majority of tumours that develop in BRCA1 mutation carriers are oestrogen receptor (ER)-negative, it seems counterintuitive that SERMs will reduce breast cancer risk, given that no benefit in ER-negative tumours has been shown in the chemoprevention setting with tamoxifen.12
--------
Currently, a number of groups are investigating inhibition of progesterone and/or RANK/RANKL signalling as an alternative chemopreventive strategy in BRCA1 carriers, which may present a more tolerable approach.24 However, a recent study using a well-characterised mouse model of BRCA1-associated breast cancer suggests that oestrogen is the predominant driver of tumourigenesis rather than progesterone.25 Given that RANK/RANKL signalling is progesterone-dependent, the efficacy of these progesterone and RANK/RANKL-targeted chemopreventive approaches remains unproven.

Importantly, while all WapCreC;Brca1;p53 double-mutant females developed mammary carcinomas, 25% of WapCreC;Rank;Brca1;p53 triple-mutant littermates never developed any tumors (Figure 2A).

Using a mouse model lacking the full-length form of BRCA1, here we show that ERalpha is highly expressed in the premalignant mammary gland and initiation stages of tumorigenesis, although its expression is gradually diminished during mammary tumor progression.

Prospective studies will be required to estimate the potential benefits of estrogen suppression therapies for the prevention and adjuvant treatment of BRCA1/BRCA2-related breast carcinomas.

Knocking down of BRCA1 or BRCA2 in TNBC cells with BRCA1 allelic loss by RNA interference significantly enhanced AZD2281-induced growth inhibition and induced significant autophagy that was associated with mitophagy in cells with BRCA mutations.

In this study, we examined the influence of the BRCA1Δ17-19 ASV, which lacks a portion of the BRCT domain, on DNA repair capacity using human MCF-7 BC cell clones with stably modified BRCA1 expression.
--------
And the difference of BRCA1 expression between two groups was statistically significant (P < 0.01); (2) In invasive sporadic ductal breast carcinoma, the positive rate of PRA expression for negative BRCA1 expression samples was 81.48% (22/27) and it was higher than the positive rate of PRA expression at 53.66% (22/47) for positive BRCA1 expression samples.
--------
It indicated that the expression of BRCA1 affected the expression rate of PRA; In invasive sporadic ductal breast carcinoma, the PRB expression rates between positive and negative BRCA1 expression samples were not statistically significant (P > 0.05).
--------
P value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.<h4>Results</h4>(1) In invasive sporadic ductal breast carcinoma, the positive rate of BRCA1 expression of 60.29% (41/68) was lower than the positive rate of BRCA1 expression at 85.30% (58/68) in adenosis of breast.

Perhaps the most interesting among BRCA1 protein-protein interactions in mammary epithelial cells is the one with the ERα.196 This apparently key anti-estrogenic effect may place the BRCA proteins on center stage for control of the sex steroid-regulated pathways, long suspected to induce breast cancer.

This review summarizes mainly the prognostic values of classical (Ki67, ER, PR, HER2) and novel molecular factors (p53, p14ARF, cyclin D1, cyclin E, TBX2/3, BRCA1/2, and VEGF) for breast cancer.
--------
We further demonstrated that mammary tumors from Brca1 mutant mice have low levels of Sirt1 and high levels of Survivin, which is reversed by induced expression of Brca1.
--------
These findings suggest that resveratrol treatment serves as an excellent strategy for targeted therapy for BRCA1-associated breast cancer.
--------
We found that human BRCA1-associated breast cancers have lower levels of SIRT1 than their normal controls.
--------
Similarly, it was shown that BRCA1, EZH2, the DNA methyltransferases DNMT1/3a/b, and H3K27me3 are recruited to the endogenous FOXO3 promoter, modulating FOXO3 methylation and expression in BC cells.
--------
BRCA1 deficiency inhibited ES cell differentiation and enhanced BC cell migration and invasion in an EZH2-dependent manner [46].
--------
In addition, BRCA1 depletion promoted the recruitment of DNMT1/3a/3b and the enrichment of the EZH2-mediated transcriptional repressive epigenetic marks H3K27me3 on the FOXO3 promoter showing crosstalk between the genetic and epigenetic changes in BC [53].
--------
Moreover, the decreased expression of BRCA1 caused genome-wide EZH2 re-targeting and elevated H3K27me3 levels at PRC2 target loci in both mouse embryonic stem (ES) and human MCF7 BC cells.

In the present study, we evaluated the potential of curcumin to re-express hypermethylated BRCA1 and to suppress hypomethylated SNCG in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cell line HCC-38, the estrogen receptor-negative/progesterone receptor-negative (ER−/PR−) cell line UACC-3199, and the ER+/PR+ cell line T47D.
--------
As curcumin is an activator for the hypermethylated BRCA1 promoter, we, therefore, believe that it holds the potential to be an effective therapeutic option for triple-negative breast cancer as well as for the prevention of breast and ovarian cancer, particularly for BRCA1-promoter methylation carriers.

Presence of β‐hCG either due to endogenous expression or by exogenous supplementation promotes tumorigenesis by inducing migration, invasion and stemness predominantly in BRCA1 mutant breast cancer cells.

We urge inhibiting β‐hCG could prove an effective treatment strategy for BRCA1 mutated breast cancers.
--------
Such mutant BRCA1 protein may be stabilized by the heat shock chaperone HSP90 as shown in MDA-MB-436 breast cancer cells (Johnson et al. 2013).
--------
The presence of deleterious TP53 mutations in most BRCA1-related breast cancers suggests that p53 loss of function is essential for BRCA1-associated tumorigenesis [332].
--------
Because BARD1 functions in the same molecular pathways as BRCA1, BARD1 is considered a good candidate as a BC susceptibility gene.
--------
Considering the interaction between BARD1 and BRCA1 and the similarities in their structures, it is surprising that BARD1 mutations are relatively rare in BC patients compared to BRCA1 mutations.
--------
Thompson et al. suggested that BARD1 mutations were associated with moderate BC risk (OR = 3.0, p = 0.62) by comparing 2000 BRCA1/2-negative BC patients with geographically matched controls, though not reaching statistical significance [45].
--------
In addition, we generated cell lines from mammary tumors and found that the cells retained many of the genetic changes found in the primary tumors, suggesting that these genes may be players in Brca1-associated tumorigenesis.

The combination therapy triggers more significant antitumor effects against tumor growth than those achieved with monotherapy in xenograft mice bearing BRCA1/2-wildtype or mutated TNBC tumors [86].

Little data on steroid receptor levels have been reported with regard to BRCA2.<h4>Methods</h4>Steroid receptor levels were analyzed in 27 breast carcinomas associated with BRCA1 mutations, 14 associated with BRCA2 mutations, and 32 from individuals who had hereditary breast carcinoma but no detectable mutations of either BRCA1 or BRCA2.
--------
Steroid receptor levels in BRCA1-related breast carcinoma have reportedly been low.

Although AKT activation promotes BRCA1 expression through phosphorylation [65], it has been shown that BRCA1 can downregulate AKT activation in different ways: by acting on upstream kinases of AKT [31,66], by ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal degradation or by activating a protein serine/threonine phosphatase PP2A in breast cancer cells (Figure 1) [67].

Breast cancer cell lines: from BRCA1-deficient and BRCA1-proficient mice
--------
Very often, EZH2 is associated with the aberrant expression of proteins with a major role in a given cancer, as, for example, BRCA1 in ovarian and breast cancers.
--------
In a recent study, using IHC or RNA sequencing on a cohort of 497 breast cancers, Puppe et al. showed that EZH2 is expressed at significantly higher levels in BRCA1-deficient breast cancers, classified through BRCA1 mutation status, BRCA1-promoter hypermethylation, or a BRCA1-like DNA copy number profile.
--------
In an accompanying in vivo experiment, EZH2 inhibition was shown to improve the antitumor effect of platinum drugs in BRCA1-deficient murine mammary tumors [77].
--------
In agreement with the previous studies, where BRCA1 mutations, which predispose to TNBC have been found to have increased ROS levels, our data shows increased ROS levels in all the TNBC cell lines studied in comparison to an ER+ breast cancer cell line or the non-tumorigenic cells.
--------
Moreover, increased ROS levels have been associated with BRCA1 mutations in this type of breast cancer (40).

On the other hand, also in breast cancer, antioxidant treatment decreased DNA lesions and tumorigenesis in a murine model of BRCA1-deficient, p53+/− breast cancer, where excessive estrogen metabolism increased cancer cell ROS production and DNA damage (48).

Consistent with this, the siRNA-based BRCA1 knockdown (BRCA1-KD) enhanced both basal and the H2O2-mediated ROS production in one normal-like (MCF10A) and two breast cancer (MCF7 and T47D) cell lines [77].
--------
A recent report demonstrated that BRCA1 polyubiquitinates G2/M cell cycle proteins including cyclin B and Cdc25C and targets these proteins to be degraded by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway in an APC/C-independent manner in breast cancer cells [104].

Interaction between BRCA1 and AhR was enhanced by xenobiotic TCDD in breast cancer cells [167] and BRCA1 was recruited to the promoter regions of CYP1A1 and CYP1B1 along with ARNT/AhR following TCDD exposure [169].
--------
The derepression of transcriptional repression of these genes by removing the ZBRK1/CtIP/BRCA1 repressor complex has been reported to enhance mammary tumor growth or tumorigenesis [149,150].
--------
BRCA1 is known to bind AhR and ARNT to activate the transcription of their target genes in breast cancer cells [167,169].

It exerts an antiproliferative effect in breast tissues of healthy women [46] and reduces mammary cancer development in mice [29], further attesting to its potential merit as a cancer risk-reducing agent in germline BRCA1/2 mutation carriers.

Disruption of the 53BP1 pathway, which rescues BRCA1 defect, was observed in subsets of sporadic TNBC.

Also, it is likely that the combined BRCA1/p53 deficiency still resulted in the same number of initial BC cells arising in all of the mice, but since RG < RD in the presence of RU-486, the BC was unable to proliferate.

Recently, loss of BRCA1 function was shown to be associated with the expansion of breast cancer stem and progenitor cells, conferring a dependency on the expression of the polycomb repressor 2 complex protein EZH2 [45, 46].

Since BRCA1 can suppress Spp1 expression [97], women with BRCA1 mutations frequently express elevated levels of Spp1 and this increase in Spp1 expression may contribute to the elevated breast cancer risk associated with BRCA1 mutations.

As a hint for its molecular rationale, UBE2T overexpression has been found to facilitate cell cycle progression and to avoid DNA repair by degrading key regulators of both functions such as p21 or BRCA1 in vitro and in vivo in BC [39].

Thereby, we could distinguish even better the three aggressive TNBC BRCA1-deficient or -mutated cell lines from the normal and luminal subtypes according to BRCA1 cytoplasmic protein levels after using etoposide.

In mice with one germline and one conditional mutant allele of Brca1 (Brca1Ko/CoMMTV-Cre), mammary tumors developed after approximately 1 year.

Using mice with germline mutations, Cressman et al. demonstrated cooperativity between p53 and Brca1 in mammary tumor formation (Table 3), with 10% of Brca1+/-Trp53-/- mice developing mammary carcinomas compared with 0% of Brca1+/-Trp53+/+ mice [37].
--------
Somatic loss of both BRCA1 and p53 resulted in the rapid and efficient formation of highly proliferative, poorly differentiated, estrogen receptor-negative mammary carcinomas, reminiscent of human basal-like breast cancer [38].

For SNV analysis, we identified 16 overlapping pathways in CTCs and metastases involved in the role of BRCA1 in DNA damage response, hereditary breast cancer signaling, and ATM signaling.

Of note, we found 16 overlapping pathways in CTCs and metastases primarily involved in the role of BRCA1 in DNA damage response, hereditary breast cancer signaling, ATM signaling, and several others (Figure 2e).

Mechanistically, germline deficiency of BRCA1 or BRCA2 induces multiple tumour proliferation genes such as TP53 or TP53BP1 and NOTCH1 that further activate signalling cascade, ultimately provoking epithelial to mesenchymal transmutation (EMT), and TNBC cell proliferation.

Depletion of Brca1 leads to defects in mouse mammary gland development and mammary tumors in humans and mice.
--------
3, 4 Notably, tumors arising from conditional Brca1-knockout mice are reminiscent of human BRCA1-associated breast cancers sharing similar morphological and molecular characteristics, and clustering with the basal molecular subtype.5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 The molecular basis of these phenotypes however, is yet to be defined.

--------
We focused on 53BP1, as the DNA end-binding protein 53BP1 is a well-known antagonist of DNA end resection and, thereby, of compensatory, error-prone DSB repair pathways in HR-defective tumor cells such as BRCA1-mutated TNBC [219,220].
--------
Satellite DNA derepression was also observed mouse and human BRCA1 deficient breast cancers.
--------
These findings provide further evidence that the BRCA1 ubiquitin ligase activity is essential for the maintenance of the ubiquityl histone H2A mark within constitutive heterochromatic regions not only in mouse tissue but also human cells derived from breast cancers.
--------
Analyses by qRT-PCR showed disrupted satellite DNA silencing in BRCA1 deficient mouse mammary tumors, but not in tissues where BRCA1 is intact (Fig. 4b).
--------
Since BRCA1 is a tumor suppressor in breast cancer we next generated mice harboring a mammary gland specific deletion of BRCA1 and analyzed the integrity of heterochromatin by qRT-PCR (Fig. 2c).
--------
The p53F/F×BRCA1F/F mice had functional p53 and BRCA1 genes and did not develop any mammary tumors.
--------
We observed a significant enrichment of HDR pathway members (including up-regulation of BRCA1, BRCA2, RAD50, and RAD51AP1) that were DE in BCX1 tumors grown in NSG-Pro mice compared to conventional NSG mice (FDR-adjusted P < 0.05; table S3), suggesting that the hPRL/PRLR signaling axis modulates HDR phenotypes in ER+ breast cancer PDX.
--------
The fact that attenuated expression of HSF1 and BRCA1 proteins were associated with the apoptotic effects of WA in both MDA-MB-231 and BT20 cells suggests that they may play a role in the anticancer action of WA in triple negative breast cancer cell lines.
--------
In summary, we report here that WA causes denaturation and proteasome-dependent degradation of HSF1 and BRCA1 proteins in MDA-MB-231 and BT20 triple-negative breast cancer cells.
--------
The purpose of this study was to examine the regulation of prosurvival factors heat shock factor 1 (HSF1) and breast cancer susceptibility gene 1 (BRCA1) by a natural withanolide withaferin A (WA) in triple negative breast cancer cell lines MDA-MB-231 and BT20.
--------
In the present study, we intended to examine the effects of WA on BRCA1 and HSF1 protein expression in MDA-MB-231 and BT20 triple-negative breast cancer cells as potential mechanisms of its anticancer action.
--------
Here, we show that macrophage‐stimulating protein (MSP) and its tyrosine kinase receptor, Recepteur d’origine nantais (RON), are potent drivers of cancer cell growth and tumor progression in a mouse model of TNBC driven by the loss of Trp53 and Brca1. After comparison of two genetically engineered mouse models of TNBC, we found that mammary tumors from K14‐Cre;Brca1F/F;Trp53F/F (KB1P) mice exhibit high endogenous levels of MSP and RON expression.
--------
Another interesting observation from this work was the upregulation of MSP and RON expression in breast cancer 1 (BRCA1)‐deficient mammary tumors compared to BRCA1 WT tumors, which suggests that MSP–RON signaling may be evolutionarily selected in highly genomically unstable tumors.

--------
First, it was shown that AKT inhibition using the investigational drug MK-2206 suppresses the initiation and progression of BRCA1-associated mammary tumors (Baek et al., 2018).
--------
More specifically, previous studies demonstrated that RANKL mediates progesterone-driven mammary carcinogenesis [8,9,10] and RANK/RANKL signalling controlled BRCA1 mutation-driven mammary tumours [11].
--------
Further, RANK/RANKL blockade impaired proliferation and expansion of mammary progenitors from human BRCA1 mutation carriers indicating a significant role of RANK/RANKL signalling in inherited BC.
--------
Moreover, denosumab is currently used to treat bone fractures of metastatic disease and RANKL inhibition has been extensively studied in preclinical tumour models [47] and is now proven as a preventive strategy for women carrying BRCA1 mutations and high risk of BC [20].
--------
In BC, on the one hand RANK signalling (driven by progesterone) controls the onset of hormone-induced BC through the expansion of mammary progenitor cells and on the other hand, RANK and RANKL also critically regulate BRCA1-mutation-driven BC.
--------
Analyzing published database for SIRT1 expression, Wang et al. found that SIRT1 expression is much lower in the BRCA1-associated breast cancer than BRCA1-wildtype breast cancer in human 40.
--------
Analyzing published database for SIRT1 expression, Wang et al. found that SIRT1 expression is much lower in the BRCA1-associated breast cancer than BRCA1-wildtype breast cancer in human 40.
--------
These data suggest that SIRT1 not only acts as a tumor suppressor in the context of BRCA1 deficiency, but also that a SIRT1 activator, such as resveratrol, could serve as an excellent strategy for targeted therapy for BRCA1-associated breast cancer.

--------
Finally, as illustrated above that SIRT1 overexpression suppresses the age-related transcriptional changes and reduces formation of colon cancer in APC+/min mice 38, BRCA1-associated mammary cancer 40, spontaneous cancers in multiple tissues of Sirt1+/-;p53+/- mice 11, and γ-irradiation induced lymphoma in p53+/- mice 42.
--------
Similar to TOP1, increased CHD3 expression was associated with BRCA1/2-related breast carcinoma, independent of TNBC and age.
--------
Multiple logistic regression was performed to estimate the predictive effects of TOP1 or CDH3 for BRCA1/2-related breast carcinomas when adjusted for triple negative breast cancer and age (Table 2).
--------
Furthermore, we found that the expression of USP30-AS1 and C9orf163 were associated with BRCA1/2 status, indicating that they were involved in breast cancer development.
--------
The clinico-pathological databases analysis showed that HER2 upregulation and PR downregulation were associated with high CHRNA6 expression, and BRCA1/2 mutation was associated with low CHRNA6 expression, suggesting that CHRNA6 may be a potential diagnostic biomarker in breast cancer.
--------
Moreover, in mouse models of mammary cancer, tumor latency is decreased and incidence of tumor formation increased in mice with both conditional inactivation of Brca1 and a p53 null allele [15].
--------
Despite recent advances in the development of GEM models of EOC [17], [18], [19], [20], [21] and the existence of mouse models of Brca1-associated inherited breast cancer [15], [16], analogous mouse models that develop Brca1-associated inherited invasive EOC have been more difficult to develop.
--------
A role for p53 in BRCA1-associated inherited breast and ovarian cancer is further supported by the cooperation of p53 with BRCA1 in the development of mammary tumor development in genetically engineered mouse (GEM) models [15], [16].
--------
This apparent cooperation of Brca1 and p53 in inherited breast and ovarian cancer in humans and in mammary tumor development in mice led us to create a mouse model of ovarian cancer by conditional inactivation of Brca1 and p53 in the ovarian epithelium.

--------
Similar to BRCA1 mutations, BARD1 mutations also lead to increased risk of triple negative breast cancer and ovarian cancer.
--------
RFC4 and BLM are known to be upregulated in BRCA1 mutant BC [72].
--------
Future research will have to determine if and how other (p120-unrelated) events such as promoter methylation of specific genes may recruit Kaiso to the nucleus and initiate subsequent epigenetic silencing in BRCA1-related invasive breast cancer.
--------
Interestingly, nuclear Kaiso was also abundant in BRCA1-associated breast cancer (p<0.001) and invasive breast cancer overexpressing EGFR (p = 0.019).
--------
Since our data does not indicate differential E-cadherin expression and localization between sporadic and BRCA1-related invasive breast cancer, this cannot explain the increase in nuclear Kaiso localization.
--------
Several evidences indicate that the DNA damage response process is frequently impaired in more aggressive breast cancers, as a consequence of either mutation or altered expression of critical components, such as BRCA1, ATM and p53.
--------
A recent research found that breast cancer type 1 susceptibility protein (BRCA1) was related with the suppression of FOXA1 expression in BC cell lines and that BRCA1 mutation was linked to FOXA1 promoter methylation and silencing in BCs [28].

Treatment of MCF-7 and MDA-MB-468 BC cell lines with I3C leads to the upregulation of BRCA1 and thus potentiation of DNA damage response [111].
--------
Likewise, BRCA1 BC-associated mutations either abolish or reduce its ability to inhibit ERα activity [26].
--------
Due to frequent p53 mutations in human BRCA1 breast cancers and mouse mammary tumors from Brca1, Brca2 and Palb2 conditional knockout models, it is often thought that p53 inactivation accelerates BRCA1/2 and PALB2-associated tumorigenesis.

In the present study, we have used suppression subtractive hybridisation (SSH) to identify genes induced by BRCA1 by comparing control MCF7 breast carcinoma cells (driver) with MCF7 cells ectopically expressing BRCA1 (tester) and generated a forward subtracted cDNA library.
--------
In conclusion, we found that SIRT4 regulation of BITCs negatively modulated mammary tumorigenesis through suppression of SIRT1 via glutamine metabolism and that SIRT4 deficiency decreased H4K16ac and BRCA1 expression in breast cancer (Figure 8G).
--------
In contrast, recent work showed an increase in luminal progenitor numbers in the breast tissue of BRCA1 mutation carriers and a correlation between the gene expression profile of normal human luminal progenitors and basal-like breast cancers.
--------
Besides, we identified H4K16ac and BRCA1 as new prime targets of SIRT4 in breast cancer.
--------
Moreover, women carrying pathogenic BRCA1 mutations exhibit higher progesterone levels compared to those at average risk [74], suggesting that continuous RANK/RANKL signaling due to elevated progesterone levels in BRCA1 carriers could be a potential mechanism contributing to the development of breast cancer.
--------
The interplay between hormonal dynamics, particularly elevated progesterone levels in BRCA1 mutation carriers, the RANK/RANKL signaling pathway, and ELF5 may provide a crucial mechanistic link to the increased breast cancer risk observed in these individuals.

In addition, a previously published difference in the mammary tissue of individuals with or without mutations in BRCA1, namely an increase in the luminal progenitor population that is implicated in BRCA1-associated BC development11,28,43, was maintained in patient-derived organoid cultures.
--------
Thus, human mammary epithelial organoid cultures could be used to model tumorigenesis for cell-of-origin studies of BRCA1-associated BCs, and now make it feasible to directly examine the impact of cancer-associated alterations on luminal progenitor cells.

--------
While current evidence suggests that hereditary breast cancer promoted by loss of Brca1 arises in luminal progenitor cells [1], the cell of origin for the majority of breast tumors, which are spontaneous in nature, remains undetermined.
--------
Gene array analysis of these cell lines indicated that genes associated with mammary luminal progenitor cells are enriched in the luminal Py230 MaCSC line compared with the claudin-low MaCSC line Py16-1 (Figure S4A, D, see Additional file 5), in concordance with data that Brca1-deficient mammary tumors also arise from luminal progenitor cells [34].
--------
In conclusion, RB1 was frequently inactivated by gross gene disruption in BRCA1 hereditary breast cancer and BRCA1-methylated sporadic basal-like breast cancer but rarely in BRCA2 hereditary breast cancer and non-BRCA1-deficient sporadic breast cancers.

The breast cancer susceptibility associated with BRCA1/2 deficiencies has been recapitulated in mouse models carrying the respective gene deletions (Evers & Jonkers, 2006).
--------
However, studies using a combination of p53 deletion and conditional Brca1 or Brca2 inactivation in skin and mammary gland epithelium (Xu et al, 1999; Jonkers et al, 2001) have demonstrated prevalent development of mammary tumours.

Indeed, Molyneux and colleagues found that ERneg luminal progenitors, and not basal stem cells, when targeted with a Brca1 mutation in mice, can yield mammary tumors that closely resemble human BRCA1 mutant (basal-like) breast cancer, at least by histological examination [5].

To investigate how the combination of docetaxel and a Mps1 inhibitor (Cpd-5) promote tumour cell death, we treated mice transplanted with BRCA1−/−;TP53−/− mammary tumours with docetaxel and/or Cpd-5.
--------
Taken together, our results show that the inhibition of Mps1 kinase together with the exposure to clinically relevant doses of taxanes enhances CIN in BRCA1−/−;TP53−/− mammary tumours.
--------
Here we show that the combination of Mps1 inhibitors and docetaxel leads to tumour cell death by elevating the levels of CIN, as evidenced by an increase in multipolar cell divisions, enhanced chromosome copy number variations and an increase in nuclear pleomorphism in BRCA1−/−;TP53−/− mammary tumours.
--------
Knockdown of BRCA1 in primary breast epithelial cells leads to an increase in cells expressing ALDH1.<h4>Methods</h4>We examined 127 breast carcinomas for expression of ALDH1, using immunohistochemistry and correlated with clinicopathological parameters as well as the BRAC1 status.<h4>Results</h4>Comparing the results for both ALDH1 and BRCA1 expression showed a significant inverse association between the two, indicating that reduced BRCA1 was more often seen in breast cancer cells expressing ALDH1 (p-value = 0.044).
--------
Cytoplasmic expression of ALDH1 was not correlated with tumour characteristics.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Taken together, our findings suggest that increased ALDH1 is inversely correlated with decreased BRCA1 in a series of unselected breast carcinomas.
--------
Ribonuclease protection assays demonstrated that Brca1 mRNA levels are similar in normal rat mammary glands and mammary carcinomas of various etiologies, including those induced by DMBA, NMU, activated-neu and activated-ras oncogenes.

The BRCA1/BARD1 RING complex, functioning as an ubiquitin (Ub) ligase, abolished in familial breast cancer with deleterious missense mutations of BRCA1[8].

This finding was corroborated by the additional analysis of the data set from Freed-Pastor et al.

As previously [17], for this analysis, we used the following list of 10 protein-coding genes with an established role in BrCa pathophysiology, namely, BRCA1 [26], BRCA2 [26], RASSF1 [27], ESR1 [28], TP53 [29], PIK3CA [30], BRMS1 [31], CDH1 [32], CST6 [33] and PTEN [34].

Also, the expression of Esr1 mRNA, encoding ERα, was found to be increased in Cdh1Δ/Δ;PtenΔ/Δ mCLCs, as compared to Brca1Δ/Δ;Trp53Δ/Δ mouse mammary tumors (Figure S3F).
--------
TOPBP1 encodes a protein that shares homology to BRCA1, is aberrantly expressed in breast carcinomas and has a critical role in DNA damage and replication checkpoint pathways [3-7].
--------
Previous study has shown that when using a conditional knockout method, the Cre-loxP system, mutation of brca1 resulted in mammary tumor formation in the mouse [36].
--------
Using the Cre-loxP system, early studies showed that the conditional knockout of brca1 induces mammary tumor and also that concurrent inactivation of p53 and Rb1 is sufficient for the induction of ovarian carcinogenesis in conditional p53 and Rb1 knockout mice [12,36].
--------
In addition, no susceptibility to mammary tumors was observed in heterozygous brca1 mutant mice [37], suggesting that the existence of the normal functioning brca1 gene is possible.
--------
Also, BC cell lines with BRCA1 pathogenic mutations were investigated by LC-MS/MS in order to obtain their metabolic signature as possible diagnostic approach.
--------
Using the MCF7 breast carcinoma cell line as a positive control, MCC5 cells expressed the full length 216 kDa BRCA1 protein and were confirmed BRCA1wt.

MRE11-mediated fork degradation is suppressed by FANCD2; FANCD2 is observed in BRCA1/2-mutated BC.

Pathway analysis of genes in this cluster revealed activation of numerous cancer-related pathways including kinetochore metaphase signaling, cell cycle control of chromosomal replication, role of BRCA1 in DNA damage response, mitotic roles of polo-like kinase, hereditary breast cancer signaling, role of CHK proteins in cell cycle checkpoint control, and estrogen-mediated S-phase entry pathways (Fig. 4A, Supplementary Table S2).

In addition, novel data show that RANKL signaling could be important in BRCA1 mutation-driven mammary cancer [13], and RANKL inhibition in breast organoids derived from pre-neoplastic BRCA mutation tissue attenuated progesterone-induced proliferation [13, 14].
--------
To examine the role of BRCA1 in the regulation of breast cancer cell stemness, we created a genetically matched pair of human breast cancer cell lines using the HCC1937 cell line derived from a Grade 3 primary ductal carcinoma with a loss-of-function mutation in the BRCA1 gene (insertion C at nucleotide 5382).

Met, which is also spontaneously amplified in a subset of Brca1/Trp53 (Smolen et al., 2006) and lunatic fringe deleted (Xu et al., 2012) mouse mammary tumors, is a receptor tyrosine kinase for hepatocyte growth factor that regulates a variety of downstream signal transduction pathways, including MAPK and PI3K-AKT (Gastaldi et al., 2010).

High levels of phospho-AKT can inhibit the HR repair pathway by suppressing the formation of BRCA1 and RAD51 foci after exposure to IR in BC [78].

As only markers that are most useful for differentiating cancer categories are found in these lists, canonical markers such as BRCA1 in Breast Adenocarcinoma are not in the top 10 for the machine learning for Breast as BRCA1 is found in a number of cancer categories.

The frequent occurrence of p53 mutations in ovarian cancers in women with BRCA1 mutations [25], [26] and the apparent cooperation of Brca1 and p53 in mouse models of mammary cancers [27]–[31] led us to perform experiments in which conditional inactivation of Brca1 was targeted to the OSE, along with the conditional inactivation the tumor suppressors p53 and/or Rb. Our results show that invasive tumors developed in all mice that had inactivation of p53 targeted to the OSE and that tumor development was accelerated in mice with concomitant inactivation of Brca1.

Here, we show that macrophage‐stimulating protein (MSP) and its tyrosine kinase receptor, Recepteur d’origine nantais (RON), are potent drivers of cancer cell growth and tumor progression in a mouse model of TNBC driven by the loss of Trp53 and Brca1. After comparison of two genetically engineered mouse models of TNBC, we found that mammary tumors from K14‐Cre;Brca1F/F;Trp53F/F (KB1P) mice exhibit high endogenous levels of MSP and RON expression.

With the help of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technology, in one of our recent studies, we found that the heterogeneous subgroups within the BRCA1-deficient mammary tumors are classified mainly due to the different activities of cell proliferation, metabolism, DNA damage response (DDR) and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) (Figure 1A) 24.

At the intertumor level, based on histopathological characteristics, basal and luminal lineage marker expression patterns and especially the whole transcriptome profiles, the BRCA1-deficient mammary tumors could be divided into four major subtypes: mesenchymal-like, luminal-like I and II, and basal/luminal mixed tumors (Figure 1B).

This was observed in a subset of BRCA1-mutant and TNBCs, concomitant with BRCA1 dysfunction due to an increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS), and was associated with a good outcome.

Moreover, in EZH2, the BRCA1-binding region overlaps with the HOTAIR-binding domain, and BRCA1 inhibits the binding of EZH2 to HOTAIR.

There was a strong relationship between reduced expression of BRCA1 with both p63 and CK5 expression as well as an inverse correlation between p63 and CK8/18 expression, suggesting that loss of p63 expression is required for the transition between a basal to a luminal phenotype of breast carcinoma.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Since p63 is thought to be a marker of stem cells and may act as an oncogene, our data support the idea that BRCA1 acts as stem cell regulator.

The PDGF/Abl tyrosine kinase inhibitor nilotinib, suppressed proliferation in LTED cells in the presence or absence of E. Nilotinib also suppressed ER-mediated transcription by destabilizing the ER and reducing recruitment of amplified in breast cancer-1 (AIB1) and the CREB binding protein (CBP) to the promoter of the E-responsive gene GREB1. High PDGFRβ in primary ER+ breast cancer of 81 patients prior to neoadjuvant treatment with an AI was associated with poorer antiproliferative response.

A recent study from Liu et al. [75] used whole-exome sequencing and RNA sequencing data from BRCA1-deficient mouse mammary tumours to identify multiple aberrations capable of activating the MAPK and/or PI3K signalling pathways.

The mammary tumors showed striking variability in histopathological patterns suggesting stochastic engagement of tumorigenic pathways in their progression, to which the Brca1(tr/tr) mutation was apparently a late participant.
--------
By inhibiting the interaction between BRCA1-BARD1, BBIT20 triggered BRCA1 cellular relocation, cell cycle arrest, and downregulated the expression of the HDR-related proteins, possibly by proteolytic degradation after the destruction of the BRCA1-BARD1 complex, thus enhancing DNA damage, ROS generation and apoptosis in triple-negative breast cancer and ovarian cancer cells [158].

It was previously suggested that basal and BRCA1-associated breast carcinomas originate from EPCAM+CD49f+ luminal progenitor cells (Proia et al., 2011; Molyneux et al., 2010).
--------
Overexpression of EZH2 is able to activate the PI3K/AKT pathway, by which BRCA1 (a tumor suppressor) were exported from nuclei, and aneuploidy and mitotic deficiency were elicited, leading to invasive breast cancer [39].

--------
Gadd45a was shown to be a direct target to the p53 and BRCA1 tumor suppressor genes, whose loss of function is known to play a vital role in breast carcinogenesis; however, the role of Gadd45a in the suppression of breast cancer remains unclear.
--------
Previous studies showed that PKM2 promoted tumor growth in xenograft models; however, depletion of PKM2 in the <i>Brca1</i>-loss-driven mammary tumor mouse model accelerates tumor formation.
--------
It is shown that estrogen (E2) acts through the PI3K-AKT pathway to regulate the activation of Nrf2 in BRCA1-deficient cells (126, 127), thereby inducing the production of antioxidant genes including GCLM and HO-1, protecting cells from ROS-induced death and enabling the survival of BC cells (128).
--------
We have studied in vivo responses of "spontaneous" Brca1- and p53-deficient mammary tumors arising in conditional mouse mutants to treatment with doxorubicin, docetaxel, or cisplatin.

Variants that affect binding between BRCA1 and BARD1 have been linked to familial breast cancer or are non-functional in the HDR assay [21,31,32].
--------
In breast cancer, UBE2T was shown to facilitate the polyubiquitination and degradation of BRCA1—an E3 ubiquitin ligase and a critical tumor suppressor gene in hereditary breast cancer--by interacting with the BRCA1/BRCA1-associated RING domain protein (BARD1) complex [25].
--------
Specifically, mouse models of a 'triple-negative' breast cancer (utilizing conditional knockout of BRCA1 and p53 in the breast), of an endometrioid ovarian cancer (based on oncogenic kras and loss of function of pten), and of anatomic and functional consequences of BRCA1 mutations in granulosa cells, have led to further inquiry into the pathogenesis and therapeutic consequences of genetic alterations.
--------
In line of these findings, benzo [a] pyrene (B[a]P), an AhR ligand, also inhibited BRCA-1 expression in MCF-7 breast cancer cells and reduced these cell proliferation in a time and dose dependent manner [39].
--------
Curcumin increases TET1 expression by down-regulation of miR-29b and TET1 re-expression, which induces BRCA1 TSG expression via demethylation of its promoter in HCC-38 BC cells.
--------
It is recognized as a potential modifier influencing the risk of BRCA1-related breast cancer.[40] MAD2L1 is an integral part of the mitotic spindle assembly checkpoint, responsible for impeding the initiation of anaphase until proper alignment of chromosomes on the metaphase plate is achieved.

--------
It has also been reported that direct interaction between the tumor suppressor, BRCA1, and ERα inhibits E2-driven VEGF transcription and secretion in breast cancer cells (Kawai et al., 2002).
--------
On the other hand, although pioglitazone inhibits aromatase expression by inhibiting proinflammatory prostaglandin E2 signaling and upregulating tumor-suppressor gene BRCA1 [21], it does not inhibit mammary tumor growth induced by N-methyl-N-nitrosourea in Sprague-Dawley rats fed a high-fat diet [22].
--------
EIF3E, another 8q-protein in the RRM2B network, interacts with ATM and BRCA1 for the execution of DNA damage response and EIF3E alterations have been previously observed in breast cancer (Morris et al., 2012).
--------
53BP1 has been recently highlighted as a novel target for BRCA1-deficient TN BC [32].
--------
Here, we show for the first time that stathmin protein expression by IHC is strongly related to BRCA1 positive breast cancers.
--------
Despite the increased number of basal cells in BRCA1-mutation carriers, this study showed that the luminal cells, and not the basal cells, were the origins of basal-like breast cancer [14].
--------
Gene expression analysis of BRCA1-associated breast cancer strongly correlates with the gene expression signature of luminal progenitor cells; BRCA1-mutation carriers in this study appeared to contain an expanded luminal progenitor population [10].
--------
It is possible that 53BP1 loss may have different effects in BRCA1-deficient tumors vs. sporadic triple-negative breast cancers.
--------
Similarly, GR, in the absence of its ligand, positively regulates BRCA1 expression in BC cells by directly interacting with the β-subunit of the transcription factor GA-binding protein (GABP) and the BRCA1 promoter region [83].
--------
Remarkably, BRCA1 has been shown to interact directly with nuclear steroid receptors in BC models, thereby acting as a repressor and a co-activator of ERα and AR transcriptional activity, respectively [82,83].
--------
<h4>Aim</h4>An attempt to analyze invasive ductal carcinomas of the breast, based on the histopathological sub classification and grading, the hormonal status on immunohistochemistry (IHC) and the BRCA1 gene expression.<h4>Methods</h4>Fifty patients were selected from the Kancheepuram area on the basis of their admissions to the Surgical Out-Patients Wing of the Meenakshi Medical College and Hospital over a period of 3 years from 2008-2011.<h4>Results</h4>Among the fifty patients who were selected in the case series, the most common age group was 41-60 years (23 patients).

--------
Thus, reduction of survivin via SIRT1 activity may play an important role in BRCA1-associated mammary tumor formation.
--------
Another important role for SIRT1 in cancer is its suppression of the apoptosis inhibitor survivin in breast cancer susceptibility gene 1 (BRCA1)-associated breast cancers [19].
--------
The same group reported that knockdown of UBC9 in BRCA1 mutant triple-negative breast cancer and HGSOC cells inhibited cell proliferation and migration, indicating the pivotal role of UBC9 in endothelial-mesenchymal transition in such cancer type [34].

Inhibition of autophagy by CQ during chemotherapy diminishes the expression of DNA repair proteins, resulting in tumor growth inhibition in carboplatin-resistant BRCA1 wild-type TNBC orthotopic xenografts [18].
--------
ID4, upregulated in the offspring of HF diet-fed dams, is associated with poor prognosis of breast cancer, inhibits BRCA1 function in basal-like breast cancer [44], and promotes chemoresistance [45].
--------
These signaling pathways such as Role of BRCA1 in DNA Damage Response, Hereditary Breast Cancer, ATM, Molecular Mechanisms of Cancer, Estrogen-Dependent Breast Cancer, Cell Cycle Regulation, p53 Signaling, FGF Signaling, Role of CHK Proteins in Cell Cycle Checkpoint Control, MYC Mediated Apoptosis, NF-kB, and PTEN Signaling pathways could serve as targets for the development of novel therapeutics.
--------
EP4 positively regulates the expression of aromatase, leading to estrogen synthesis and reduces the expression of BRCA1 in breast cancer.28
--------
Additionally, higher levels of choline metabolites were found in response to DTX treatment in BRCA1-mutated mouse mammary tumors, suggesting a potential role of choline as a biomarker for predicting DTX therapy response [48].
--------
For instance, recent reports showed that PKM2 deficiency in mice did not block Brca1 loss-driven mammary tumor formation but inhibited cyclin D1 expression and leukemia initiation induced by BCR-ABL and MLL-AF9 43, 44.
--------
Thus, EMT promotion in triple-negative basal-like breast cancer cells that have BRCA1 dysfunction may be independent of GR.
--------
One of these compounds, adenosine 5’-monophosphate (A5MP), selectively inhibited the growth of BRCA1-deficient HCC1937 breast carcinoma cells (adenosine was added to the cells and phosphorylated intracellular), even though that RAD52 does not have a nucleotide binding site.
--------
AICAR showed biological activity in human cells by selective inhibition of growth of BRCA1-deficient HCC1937 breast carcinoma cells, BRCA1-deficient BCR-ABL1-positive leukemia cells, and BRCA2-deficient Capan-1 pancreatic adenocarcinoma cells.
--------
In support of this notion, the selective removal of the Brca1 gene from K14 and K6a-positive basal epithelial cells is not sufficient to trigger the development of mammary cancer [82].
--------
In contrast, mammary tumors form in aging mice where the Brca1 gene is conditionally deleted using the MMTV-Cre or WAP-Cre transgenes [83].
--------
Furthermore, the RANKL/RANK signaling in mammary progenitor cells is critical for the initiation and progression of breast cancer susceptibility gene 1 (BRCA1) mutation-driven mammary cancer (Fig. 4a) [102, 103].
--------
Targeting the RANKL/RANKL axis may be a rational prevention strategy for patients with BRCA1 mutation-positive breast cancer.
--------
Therefore, the direct or indirect interaction among TP53, BRCA1, MDM4, and MYC can increase the tumor aggressiveness, and therapies targeting these pathways are promising strategies for treating IBC.
--------
Expression of the CA9 protein and the BRCA1 (breast cancer 1) protein are inversely correlated in patients with breast cancer.
--------
In our studies, HMMR is associated with breast cancer poor prognosis; it is also known for the relationship with BRCA1 and BRCA2. CKS2, KIF4A, RACGAP1, and SHCBP1 all have positive correlation with HMMR. Therefore, they have the possibility to become combination biomarkers as indicator of prognosis for different subtypes of breast cancer especially TNBC and targets of this disease.
--------
The study revealed that beta hCG expression is related to the BRCA1 status, with overexpression observed in cases of breast carcinoma with BRCA1 mutation19.
--------
In basal-like and BRCA1-related breast cancers, ROS expression was correlated with AhR levels and the expression of the chemokines CXCL1, CXCL2, and CCL5.
--------
In a mouse model of BRCA1-associated breast cancer, AhR was found to transcriptionally induce the EGF receptor ligand, Amphiregulin, driving tumor growth and macrophage infiltration.
--------
Females of these Brca1 GEMM do not form mammary tumors in the first 10 months of life.
--------
However, the possibility that this mechanism explain the BRCA1 silencing observed in breast cancer cells treated with ethanol, not yet been explored.
--------
Another study showed that 71% of neuroendocrine carcinomas of the cervix had lost BRG1 expression [13] and BRG1 has been implicated in breast cancer through its role in estrogen receptor dependent transcription [35], its interaction with the breast cancer susceptibility gene BRCA1 [27] and because BRG1 haploinsufficient mice are prone to mammary tumors [23].
--------
Furthermore, in a screen for genes promoting mammary tumour development in BRCA1-deficient mice, Notch1 was identified as a strong driver [32], and there are several reports indicating that elevated Notch signalling induces and accelerates mammary tumour formation [33–38].

--------
We present several lines of evidence for the mechanism of BRCA1 degradation through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway by using specific inhibitors of the proteasome in human MCF-7 breast carcinoma cells.
--------
Interestingly, in the present study, treatment with ROSI caused induction of BRCA1 expression in PPARγ-WT, but not PPARγ-MG KO mouse mammary tumours.
--------
Somatic loss of both BRCA1 and p53 resulted in the rapid and efficient formation of highly proliferative, poorly differentiated, estrogen receptor-negative mammary carcinomas, reminiscent of human basal-like breast cancer [38].
--------
Identifying individual or combination therapies that can inhibit this subtype of breast cancer using the C3(1)/Tag or other models with basal-type characteristics – BRCA1-/-, p53+/-, or p53-/- models – would provide an extremely important advance in treating this aggressive form of the disease.
--------
Several mouse models of mammary cancer display basal-type characteristics and cluster with human basal-type tumors, including Brca1+/-, p53+/-, irradiated [19], Brca1co/co, TgMMTV-Cre, p53+/- [20], and some DMBA-induced tumors [7,8,21].
--------
We performed whole-exome sequencing (WES) and RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) to identify somatic genetic alterations in mouse models of TNBCs driven by loss of <i>Trp53</i> alone or in combination with <i>Brca1</i> Amplifications or translocations that resulted in elevated oncoprotein expression or oncoprotein-containing fusions, respectively, as well as frameshift mutations of tumor suppressors were identified in approximately 50% of the tumors evaluated.
--------
This suggests that low levels of EZH2 are necessary to regulate normal mammary epithelial cell proliferation; however, EZH2 overexpression in ER-negative MDA-MB-231 cells results in decreased BRCA1 and uncontrolled proliferation which contributes to tumorigenesis of breast carcinoma [24].
--------
Functionally, it has been shown that ID4 may exert similar inhibitory effects on BRCA1 and estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) gene expression, and, conversely, BRCA1 and ERα may demonstrate redundancy in inhibiting ID4 gene expression in breast cancer cells and tissues [8].

A biomimetic bilayer lipid membrane supported MXene based biosensor is reported for electrochemical hybridization detection of the most prevalent and potential BC biomarker BRCA1.
--------
Considering the induction of ZNF423 in ER+ BC with estrogen and its ability to induce BRCA1, future studies may concern an evaluation of the expression in specific types of BC as well as in ovarian cancer and if ZNF423 could be considered a useful biomarker or a therapeutic target in conjunction with SERMs or with PARP1 inhibitors.
--------
Deleterious germline variants in the BRCA1-associated ring domain (BARD1) gene moderately elevate breast cancer risk; however, their potential association with other neoplasms remains unclear.
--------
Moreover, basal cytokines CK5/6 and CK14 are expressed in basal-like tumors, resulting in an even more increased probability of BRCA1 mutation and an even more decreased probability of BRCA2 mutation, as seen in row 4 of Table 3 (representing, in fact, basal-like and triple-negative BCs).
--------
Future studies will show whether Jak2 is also required for the genesis of breast cancer subtypes that express basal epithelial cell markers such Brca1-associated mammary tumors (Triplett et al., 2008).
--------
Two independent studies have indicated that basal-like Brca1-associated human and mouse mammary tumors originate from luminal epithelial progenitors [14,32].
--------
Gene expression profiling and targeted disruption of BRCA1 in mouse models suggest that luminal progenitors are likely target cell population of basal-like breast cancer harboring BRCA1 mutations1, 61, 62.
--------
These high levels of ROS production that drive the aggressiveness in TNBC result from oncogenic gene mutations, e.g., BRCA1 [138], gene expression changes, e.g., BLT2 [139], and the attainment of stem-cell like properties [140].
--------
Since most BRCA1-related breast carcinomas (heritable mutations or sporadic defects) are frequently triple negative cancers (reviewed in Diaz et al. [27]) with BRCA1 protein downregulation, EZH2 is most likely upregulated in these carcinomas.
--------
Multiple cell cycle proteins (RB1, p53, BRCA1 and BRCA2) and survival signaling pathways (PTEN and PIK3CA) are involved in BC and can affect the response to treatment [43,44].
--------
Past work has demonstrated that nuclear Kaiso expression is enriched in basal-like/triple-negative breast cancers and in BRCA1 associated invasive breast cancer, and is inversely correlated with cytosolic p120 [41].
--------
Luminal progenitors are expanded in BRCA1 mutation carriers and linked to basal-like breast cancers, whereas stem- and progenitor-enriched basal cells are associated with claudin-low breast cancers (Lim et al., 2009; Molyneux et al., 2010; Shehata et al., 2012).

--------
However, homozygous mice with certain hypomorphic Brca1 alleles can survive to adulthood and display an increased susceptibility to a range of tumors, including mammary carcinomas [61].
--------
It was shown that phosphorylation of curcumin, increased expression and BRCA1 protein caused DNA damage in association with cytoplasmic retention in triple negative breast cancer cells (Rowe et al., 2009).
--------
These BRCA1 defective breast cancers contained expanded luminal progenitor cells [48].
--------
However, in apparent contrast with these findings, it was observed that PKM2 deletion accelerates tumor formation in a BRCA1-deficient breast cancer mouse model, suggesting that PKM2 is not necessary for tumor cell proliferation [118].
--------
These findings, however, contrast with the above-mentioned evidence of a PKM2 role in carcinogenesis and they could represent the specific behavior of the BRCA1-deficient mouse breast cancer cells.
--------
Female mice of this strain showed a high incidence of mammary carcinomas that displayed important hallmarks of human BRCA1-associated breast tumours: tumours were poorly differentiated, highly proliferative, genomically instable, ER-negative and showed an increased expression of basal epithelial markers (Table 1).
--------
Indeed, homozygous Brca1Tr mouse mutants that express BRCA1-Δ11 are viable on a BALB/c genetic background, but develop various tumours including mammary carcinomas after long latency (Ludwig et al, 2001).
--------
In BRCA1-BER-deficient breast carcinoma, ATM and DNA-PKcs may be inhibited as a better treatment strategy.
--------
Accumulation of 53BP1 is associated with human TNBC and BRCA1-related BCs (37) and contributes to their resistance to poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors (38).
--------
Some of the common downstream targets of 1,25(OH)2D3 signaling in breast cancer cells include BRCA1, p21, p53, cMYC, E-Cadherin, and Cyclin D1, which contribute to cell cycle arrest, differentiation, and, at times, apoptosis [20,52,64,65].
--------
Similarly, mice with mammary gland-specific deletion of full-length Brca1 but retention of Brca1-Δ11 develop mammary adenocarcinomas characterised by genetic instability (Xu et al, 1999a).
--------
Similarly, mice with mammary gland-specific deletion of full-length Brca1 but retention of Brca1-Δ11 develop mammary adenocarcinomas characterised by genetic instability (Xu et al, 1999a).
--------
These results suggest that by inducing a G2/M checkpoint via a still unknown mechanism involving BRCA1, HER4 impairs the proliferation of breast cancer cells [2].
--------
Interestingly, HER4 mRNA expression has been found to correlate with BRCA1 mRNA expression in human breast cancer samples and requires BRCA1 activity for NRG-1-mediated breast cell growth inhibition, as shown by in vitro and in vivo BRCA1 knockdown studies [80].
--------
However, mammary carcinomas can be induced by concurrent inactivation of Brca1 together with p53 (aka TP53/Trp53) gene, another tumor suppressor gene commonly inactivated in familial breast carcinomas.

In addition, BRCA1/2 dysregulation in breast cancer, including TNBC, may influence PPARγ expression indirectly via modifications in the cellular environment.
--------
Their ectopic expression in BC drug-resistant cells induced sensitivity through directly targeting BRCA1 expression.
--------
A report by Lim and colleagues26 suggested that luminal progenitors are the cellular targets for the genesis of basal-like, triple-negative tumors in women with BRCA1-associated hereditary breast cancer.
--------
Using either CD44+/CD24- or CD133+ cells isolated from Brca1-deficient mouse mammary tumors, expression of Sox1 was found to be significantly higher in these cells when compared to their counterparts [46].
--------
More recently, Nolan and colleagues have also shown the potential of RANKL as a therapeutic target in a Brca1-deficient mouse model, while in normal breast tissue of BRCA1-mutation carriers, identifying luminal RANK(+) progenitors that are highly proliferative and bear a molecular signature similar to that of basal-like BC, this indicates RANKL inhibition as a promising strategy in the prevention setting [72•].

--------
It was demonstrated that ID4, as the direct target of miR342, is one of the essential players regulating cell proliferation and invasion.26,27 Moreover, it was reported that miR342 could affect BRCA1 expression indirectly via direct inhibition of ID4 in MDA-MB-231 triple-negative breast cancer cells.28 In fact, ID4 is an oncogene whose inhibitory role on the regulation of BRCA1 tumor suppressor factor was detected before.29
--------
Jin et al. (2010) reported that UHRF1 is overexpressed in BRCA1 hyper methylated breast tumor tissues and overexpression of UHRF1 in breast cancer cell lines led to deacetylation of H3/H4 followed by DNMT1 recruitment on to BRCA1 promoter and hypermethylation (Jin et al. 2010).
--------
It was discovered that BRCA1 mutation carriers harbor a subset of mammary progenitor cells that are the likely origin for basal-like BCs in these women [100,101].
--------
More recently, it became apparent that it is in fact the RANK-positive subset among these progenitor cells, which have cancer-like properties, and are therefore the most likely origin of BRCA1-related BC [102].
--------
BRCA1-deficient mouse mammary tumor cells are selectively sensitive to an inhibitor of EZH2 [151].
--------
Although both Brca1 and Cdh1 are strongly associated with breast cancer when mutated, it may be that conditional deletion of E-cadherin, even in the context of concomitant p53 inactivation, may not be tolerated in Lgr6POS mammary progenitor cells or provides a selective disadvantage in these cells.
--------
Conditional knock out of either Brca1 or Bard1 in murine mammary epithelial cells led to the development of mammary carcinomas that are indistinguishable from each other (Shakya et al., 2008), and the BRCA1 C61G mutant that abrogates BARD1 binding failed to suppress mammary tumor development in mice (Drost et al., 2011).

BCSCs populations were also implicated in resistance to platinum compounds in a BRCA1/p53-mutated mouse mammary tumor model, being responsible for the development of chemoresistance, clonal evolution, and tumor progression upon chemotherapy treatment [81].
--------
Subsequently, populations of CD24+CD29+ cells and CD24+CD49f+ cells were isolated from BRCA1-mutated mammary tumors and displayed self-renewal and tumor-initiating capacity in vivo [15].
--------
In addition, it was found that in vivo PPARγ expression in mammary stromal adipocytes attenuates breast tumorigenesis through breast cancer 1 (BRCA1) upregulation and decreased leptin secretion, and that 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene (DMBA) plus Rosiglitazone is able to reduce average mammary tumor volumes by 50% [72].

--------
Importantly, in triple-negative breast cancer, which is frequently associated with a nonfunctional BRCA1 and FA pathway, 53BP1 was found to be downregulated in a subset of the cases associated with reduced therapeutic responsiveness and probability of survival.54, 55 Therefore, our findings also impact on the design of personalized treatment regimens of breast cancer patients with a PALB2 c.1592delT mutation.
--------
Recently, basal-like sporadic and familial cases of breast cancer have been linked to BRCA1 gene inactivation, which enables the upregulation of the target-repressed CDH3/P-cadherin gene, an important biomarker of basal-like breast carcinomas.

Data from murine models and human BRCA1-related hereditary breast cancers suggest that both unique and specific BRCA1-associated p53 mutations may be found in BRCA1-related ovarian cancers.<h4>Experimental design</h4>The p53 mutational spectrum from ovarian cancers containing either somatic or germ-line BRCA1 mutations was compared with that of sporadic ovarian cancers defined as those diagnosed with a negative family history for breast/ovarian cancer in a three-generation pedigree.
--------
The ternary complex formation protects cells from DNA damage by promoting DNA repair, and supports the growth of BRCA1-null mammary tumors (54).
--------
Interestingly, human germ line mutation of BRCA1 has been shown to stimulate luminal-to-basal tumor formation by affecting the luminal progenitor cell pool and luminal cell fate [28], [29], exemplifying a consequence of the involvement of breast cancer susceptibility variants in MEC differentiation.
--------
If one role of ATM/ ATR is to transmit cell cycle or DNA damage signals to BRCA1 and p53, then this may explain why loss (or partial loss) of ATM function may lead to an increase in susceptibility to breast cancer.
--------
For example, Wap-Cre driven mutation of Smad4 and Brca2 causes a very high frequency of affected mice to develop mammary tumors (100% and 77%, respectively), whereas only 15% of mice with Wap-Cre driven mutation of Brca1 develop mammary tumors and no tumors are obtained following Wap-Cre driven mutation of Pparγ or Stat3[43]–[47].
--------
That a marker of a differentiated normal mammary epithelial cell could enrich for cells with TIC activity in the context of breast cancer is also supported by recent evidence from multiple laboratories that, in BRCA1 basal-like tumors, the TIC population arises from the luminal lineage [63-65].
--------
In a BRCA1-mutant BC mice model, Nolan et al.

In another study, we were able to show that RXRα and PPARγ are overexpressed in BRCA1 mutated breast cancer cases and predict prognosis [25].
--------
Conversely, exposure to GCs induces a loss of GR recruitment to the BRCA1 promoter concomitant to a decrease in BRCA1 expression, highlighting the role of GCs in inducing BC [52].

--------
We cannot exclude the possibility that the culture conditions for BC-PDMs may favor the selection and outgrowth of BC subclones with a basal epithelial phenotype (CK5/CK6+), which are often associated with BRCA-1 mutated BC [96, 97] and are underrepresented in the primary tumor.
--------
In BRCA1-associated breast cancer, TRβ is a positive prognostic factor of OS at 5 years post-treatment, while TRα positivity predicts a reduced OS at 5 years posy-treatment [43].
--------
Breast cancers in the BRCA1 mutation carriers have a distinct basal-like phenotype, yet these tumours originated from luminal epithelial progenitors instead of from basal stem cells [39,40].
--------
A restricted progenitor can, for other malignancies, act as the initiating cell, as reported, for example, for BRCA1-associated breast cancers [39,40].
--------
Although YY1 positively regulates BRCA1 and inhibits mammary cancer formation;35 increasing evidence confirms that YY1 regulates various pro-tumorigenic pathways by activating human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2; ERBB2, neu)7,34 and EGFR.36
--------
Demonstrating the negative role of BRCA1 in PRC2 complex activity [76] raised the question whether this crucial tumour suppressor gene could have any potential correlation with HOTAIR? Investigations showed that HOTAIR could carry action against BRCA1 to positively regulate PRC2 complex in breast cancer.

The addition of n-3 PUFAs has been reported to increase Brca1 expression in rat mammary tumors [41].
--------
Hemalatha et al. speculate that BC cells harboring mutations in genes involved in cell motility, such as BRCA1, may convert BCAFs into the so-called metastasis associated fibroblasts (MAFs), i.e., CAFs with enhanced capability to promote cancer cell migration, invasion and metastasis.
--------
They demonstrated that BCAFs treated with the conditioned medium of BRCA1-mutated BC cells acquire an altered phenotype, characterized by increased expression of metastatic and EpMT markers, including Ezrin, CCL5, and N-Cadherin.
--------
The potential importance of the E3 ligase activity of BRCA1 in cellular pathways is supported by the observation that missense mutations within RING finger domain of BRCA1, which cause familial breast cancer, abolish the E3 activity [89-93].

The rest hub nodes contains well known cancer divers, such as BRCA1, indicating the important roles of PRKD3 in invasive breast cancer.
--------
In agreement, Lim et al [11] and Molyneux et al [31] have demonstrated that the cell of origin of BRCA1 defective breast carcinomas, a predominantly triple negative type of breast cancer, is also in the Ep-CAMhigh/CD49f + luminal progenitor cells.
--------
Moreover, the IGF-IR promoter can be repressed by genes, such as p53 and BRCA1, which are frequently mutated in basal-like breast cancer, resulting in elevated IGF-IR expression (Werner et al., 1996; Sarfstein et al., 2006).
--------
Another novel finding of this study is that BRCA1 expression is strongly associated with the high AHR-expressing ERα-negative subpopulation, indicating a possible implication of AHR in DNA repair in ERα-negative breast cancers.
--------
MYC overexpression inhibits BRCA1’s tumor suppressor and causes the development of basal-like BC; therefore, targeting MYC-regulated pathways provides a promising therapeutic strategy for BC82.
--------
Aside from inactivation of the BRCA1 tumor-suppressor gene, little is known concerning the mechanisms that cause basal breast cancer or the mechanisms responsible for its invasiveness.
--------
Kim et al. demonstrated that deleted breast cancer 1 (DBC1) deficiency resulted in apoptosis of breast cancer cells through impaired responses to ultraviolet-induced DNA damage [34].
--------
This is consistent with the emerging association between an altered luminal progenitor profile in basal breast cancers associated with BRCA1 mutations, rather than the mesenchymal profile seen in breast CSC.
--------
BRCA1 was also been reported to be related with the sensitivity of Topo1 poison in a study of mice model with mammary tumors [36].
--------
BRCA1 (breast cancer type 1) protein transcriptionally suppresses GOT2 expression, but this mechanism is impaired by BRCA1 deficiency often seen in TNBC [80].

--------
To date, heterozygous inactivation of any of the other tumor suppressor genes implicated in breast cancer, including P53, Brca1, Brca2, and Rb, has failed to cooperate with Wnt-1 in promoting the appearance of mammary tumors [reviewed in ref. 39].
--------
Among the best-known cancer clinical markers with E3-Ub ligase activity are BRCA1 (breast cancer type 1 susceptibility protein) and TRIM25; BRCA1 is an important player in breast cancer, and one of its diverse functions is to mediate the formation of Lys-6-linked polyubiquitination as well as DNA damage repair[23].

--------
It has been reported that CD44+/CD24−/low cells were more common in basal-like tumors and strongly associated with BRCA1 hereditary breast cancer; however, not every basal breast tumor contains CD44+/CD24−/low cells [38].
--------
Available mouse models of ductal carcinoma <i>in situ</i> (DCIS) and BRCA1-mutation-related breast cancer are reviewed.

Using the K14cre;Brca1(F5-13/F5-13);p53(F2-10/F2-10) mouse model for hereditary breast cancer, we have previously studied responses of mammary tumors to clinically relevant anti-cancer drugs, including cisplatin.
--------
Variants that affect binding between BRCA1 and BARD1 have been linked to familial breast cancer or are non-functional in the HDR assay [21,31,32].
--------
hOGG1 is induced not only under oxidative conditions, but interestingly also by BRCA1 protein, deficiency of which is common in TNBCs (Mabley et al, 2005; Saha et al, 2010).
--------
A previous study demonstrated that alcohol down-regulated the expression of BRCA1, a potent inhibitor of ERα, thereby contributing to breast cancer [26].
--------
In contrast, we recently found that mouse mammary tumors containing irrepairable null alleles of the Brca1 gene do not become resistant to cisplatin ever, although they invariably become resistant to a variety of other anti-cancer drugs.
--------
EZN-2208 (PEG-SN38) was found to overcome the ATP-binding cassette superfamily G member 2 (ABCG2)-mediated topotecan resistance by increasing the DNA damage repair in breast cancer 1 (BRCA1)-deficient mouse mammary tumors [137,138], while chetomin blocked the reprogramming of tumor metabolism in human malignant glioma cells to prevent hypoxic radioresistance [139].

--------
We already demonstrated that cytoplasmic PPARγ is overexpressed in BRCA1 mutated BC compared to sporadic cases, but without correlation to survival [27].
--------
In fact, this was the case in BRCA1-deficient plus p53+/− mouse mammary tumor model.
--------
GEM models that contained a conditional mutant BRCA1 allele and a disruption in TP53 have accelerated mammary tumor development (116).
